An outbreak was suspected. No ST82 isolates were found in environmental samples and no external source was established. Four putative-outbreak ST82 isolates were retrospectively subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS) followed by phylogenetic analyses with epidemiologically unrelated ST82 sequences. The four putative-outbreak ST82 sequences fell into two clades, the two clades were separated by ca‰Ûä1,700 single nt polymorphisms (SNP)s when recombination regions were included but only by 12 to 21 SNPs when these were removed. A single putative-outbreak ST82 isolate sequence segregated in the first clade. The other three clustered in the second clade, where all included sequences had‰Ûä&lt;‰Ûä5 SNP differences between them. Intriguingly, this clade also comprised epidemiologically unrelated isolate sequences from the UK and Denmark dating back as early as 2011. The study confirms that recombination plays a major role in L. pneumophila evolution. On the other hand, strains belonging to the same ST can have only few SNP differences despite being sampled over both large timespans and geographic distances. These are two important factors to consider in outbreak investigations.",PMC5490456,10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.25.30558,genome;outbreak;phylogeny;community,genome;outbreak;phylogeny;international;geography,Legionella pneumophila,Y,

As opposed to profiling techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, WGS requires a variety of computational methods. Since 2013, United States agencies responsible for food safety including the CDC, FDA, and USDA, have been performing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on all Listeria monocytogenes found in clinical, food, and environmental samples. Each year, more genomes of other foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, and Salmonella enterica are being sequenced. Comparing thousands of genomes across an entire species requires a fast method with coarse resolution; however, capturing the fine details of highly related isolates requires a computationally heavy and sophisticated algorithm. Most L. monocytogenes investigations employing WGS depend on being able to identify an outbreak clade whose inter-genomic distances are less than an empirically determined threshold. When the difference between a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can help distinguish between genomes that are likely outbreak-associated and those that are less likely to be associated, we require a fine-resolution method. To achieve this level of resolution, we have developed Lyve-SET, a high-quality SNP pipeline. We evaluated Lyve-SET by retrospectively investigating 12 outbreak data sets along with four other SNP pipelines that have been used in outbreak investigation or similar scenarios. To compare these pipelines, several distance and phylogeny-based comparison methods were applied, which collectively showed that multiple pipelines were able to identify most outbreak clusters and strains. Currently in the US PulseNet system, whole genome multi-locus sequence typing (wgMLST) is the preferred primary method for foodborne WGS cluster detection and outbreak investigation due to its ability to name standardized genomic profiles, its central database, and its ability to be run in a graphical user interface. However, creating a functional wgMLST scheme requires extended up-front development and subject-matter expertise. When a scheme does not exist or when the highest resolution is needed, SNP analysis is used. Using three Listeria outbreak data sets, we demonstrated the concordance between Lyve-SET SNP typing and wgMLST.

The zoonotic potential and origin of these AIVs immediately became matters of concern. One virus of each subtype H5N1 (150169a), H5N2 (150233) and H5N9 (150236) was characterised. All proved highly pathogenic for poultry as demonstrated molecularly by the presence of a polybasic cleavage site in their HA protein - with a sequence (HQRRKR/GLF) previously unknown among avian H5 HPAI viruses - or experimentally by the in vivo demonstration of an intravenous pathogenicity index of 2.9 for the H5N1 HP isolate. Phylogenetic analyses based on the full genomes obtained by NGS confirmed that the eight viral segments of the three isolates were all part of avian Eurasian phylogenetic lineage but differed from the Gs/Gd/1/96-like lineage. The study of the genetic characteristics at specific amino acid positions relevant for modulating the adaptation to and the virulence for mammals showed that presently, these viruses possess most molecular features characteristic of AIV and lack some major characteristics required for efficient respiratory transmission to or between humans.

We aimed to implement a novel strategy to optimize the identification and control of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB in a specific population.METHODS: We developed a strain-specific PCR tailored from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data to track a specific MDR prevalent strain in Equatorial Guinea (EG-MDR).RESULTS: The PCR was applied prospectively on remnants of GeneXpert reaction mixtures owing to the lack of culture facilities in Equatorial Guinea. In 147 (93%) of 158 cases, we were able to differentiate between infection by the EG-MDR strain or by any other strain and found that 44% of all rifampicin-resistant TB cases were infected by EG-MDR. We also analysed 93 isolates obtained from Equatorial Guinea 15 years ago, before MDR-TB had become the problem it is today. We found that two of the scarce historical MDR cases were infected by EG-MDR. WGS revealed low variability-six single nucleotide polymorphisms acquired by this strain over 15 years-likely because of the lack in the country of a specific program to treat MDR-TB.CONCLUSIONS: Our novel strategy, which integrated WGS analysis and strain-specific PCRs, represents a low-cost, rapid and transferable strategy that allowed a prospective efficient survey and fast historical analysis of MDR-TB in a population.",NA,NA,drug resistance;characterization;genome,,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,M,could be just tehcnique

Here, we assess the evolution and resistance acquisition dynamics of E. faecium in a clinical context using a series of 132 bloodstream infection isolates from a single hospital. All isolates, of which 49 (37 %) were vancomycin-resistant, underwent whole-genome sequencing. E. faecium was found to be subject to high rates of recombination with little evidence of sequence importation from outside the local E. faecium population. Apart from disrupting phylogenetic reconstruction, recombination was frequent enough to invalidate MLST typing in the identification of clonal expansion and transmission events, suggesting that, where available, whole-genome sequencing should be used in tracing the epidemiology of E. faecium nosocomial infections and establishing routes of transmission. Several forms of the Tn1549-like element-vanB gene cluster, which was exclusively responsible for vancomycin resistance, appeared and spread within the hospital during the study period. Several transposon gains and losses and instances of in situ evolution were inferred and, although usually chromosomal, the resistance element was also observed on a plasmid background. There was qualitative evidence for clonal expansions of both vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium with evidence of hospital-specific subclonal expansion. Our data are consistent with continuing evolution of this established hospital pathogen and confirm hospital vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium patient transmission events, underlining the need for careful consideration before modifying current E. faecium infection control strategies.",PMC5049587,10.1099/mgen.0.000048,control;drug resistance;mBio;genome;cluster,control;drug resistance;mBio;genome;cluster;whole genome,Enterococcus faecium,Y,

Although Mozambique can be considered a hot spot for emerging infectious diseases due to factors such as a rich vector population and a close vector/human/wildlife interface, the viral flora in mosquitoes have not previously been investigated. In this study, viral metagenomics was employed to analyze the viral communities in Culex and Mansonia mosquitoes in the Zambezia province of Mozambique. Among the 1.7 and 2.6 million sequences produced from the Culex and Mansonia samples, respectively, 3269 and 983 reads were classified as viral sequences. Viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Iflaviridae families were detected, and different unclassified single- and double-stranded RNA viruses were also identified. A near complete genome of a flavivirus, tentatively named Cuacua virus, was obtained from the Mansonia mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analysis of this flavivirus, using the NS5 amino acid sequence, showed that it grouped with 'insect-specific' viruses and was most closely related to Nakiwogo virus previously identified in Uganda. Both mosquito genera had viral sequences related to Rhabdoviruses, and these were most closely related to Culex tritaeniorhynchus rhabdovirus (CTRV). The results from this study suggest that several viruses specific for insects belonging to, for example, the Flaviviridae and Rhabdoviridae families, as well as a number of unclassified RNA viruses, are present in mosquitoes in Mozambique.",PMC5040392,10.1371/journal.pone.0162751,surveillance;genome;phylogeny,surveillance;genome;phylogeny;diversity;vector,Microbiota,Y,

The isolates shared several phenotypic features of both B. anthracis and B. cereus, but differed amongst each other in motility and their resistance or sensitivity to penicillin. They all possessed the same mutation in the regulator gene plcR, different from the one found in B. anthracis, and in addition, carry genes which enable them to produce a second capsule composed of hyaluronic acid. Our findings show the existence of a discrete clade of the B. cereus group capable of causing anthrax-like disease, found in areas of high biodiversity, which are possibly also the origin of the worldwide distributed B. anthracis.

The 182 genomes all share &gt;99% identity, indicating minimal variation among MERS-CoV genomes. MERS-CoV is a lineage C Betacoronavirus (ÌÙCoV). MERS-CoV genomes can be roughly divided into two clades: clade A, which contains only a few strains, and clade B, to which most strains belong. In contrast to ORF1ab and structural proteins, the putative proteins encoded by ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5 and ORF8b in the MERS-CoV genome do not share homology with any known host or virus protein, other than those of its closely related lineage C ÌÙCoVs. Human and dromedary viral genomes have intermingled, indicating that multiple camel-to-human transmission events have occurred. The multiple origins of MERS-CoV suggest that the virus has been resident in dromedaries for many years. This is consistent with the detection of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels as early as the 1980s.L‰ÛªÌ©mergence du syndrome respiratoire du Moyen-Orient (SRMO, ou MERS d‰ÛªaprÌ¬s son sigle anglais) et l‰Ûªidentification en 2012 du coronavirus responsable de cette maladie (MERS-CoV) indiquent que nous sommes en prÌ©sence d‰Ûªune Ì©pidÌ©mie semblable ÌÊ celle du syndrome respiratoire aigu sÌ©vÌ¬re (SRAS). Toutefois, contrairement ÌÊ l‰ÛªÌ©pidÌ©mie du SRAS qui avait rapidement disparu en moins d‰Ûªun an, le MERS persiste depuis plus de trois ans.

Les gÌ©nomes des virus affectant l‰Ûªhomme et le dromadaire se sont entremÌ»lÌ©s, ce qui montre que le virus a connu de multiples Ì©pisodes de transmission des camÌ©lidÌ©s ÌÊ l‰Ûªhomme. Les origines multiples du MERS-CoV tÌ©moignent d‰Ûªune prÌ©sence prolongÌ©e du virus (plusieurs annÌ©es) chez les dromadaires.

Pero a diferencia de lo ocurrido con la epidemia de SRAS, que en menos de un aÌ±o habÌ_a desaparecido, el MERS lleva mÌÁs de tres aÌ±os presente. En el mundo se han notificado mÌÁs de 1.600 casos de MERS, y la enfermedad presenta una tasa de letalidad muy alta y preocupante, superior al 30%. Hasta ahora se han secuenciado un total de 182 genomas del MERS-CoV, 94 de ellos obtenidos a partir de personas y 88 a partir de dromedarios. Estos 182 genomas comparten identidad en mÌÁs de un 99%, lo que pone de manifiesto un nivel mÌ_nimo de variaciÌ_n entre los genomas coronavÌ_ricos. El coronavirus del MERS pertenece al linaje C del gÌ©nero Betacoronavirus (ÌÙCoV). Los genomas de este virus pueden ser divididos, a grandes rasgos, en dos clados: el clado A, que agrupa unas pocas cepas; y el clado B, al que pertenecen la gran mayorÌ_a de las cepas. A diferencia de lo que ocurre con la proteÌ_na ORF1ab y las proteÌ_nas estructurales, las proteÌ_nas que supuestamente codifican los genes ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5 y ORF8b del genoma del MERS-CoV no comparten homologÌ_a con ninguna proteÌ_na conocida de otros virus o anfitriones, salvo con proteÌ_nas de otros betacoronavirus del linaje C estrechamente emparentados con Ì©l. Los genomas de los virus que afectan a personas y dromedarios se han entremezclado, lo que indica que se han producido numerosos episodios de transmisiÌ_n de camÌ©lidos a humanos. De los mÌ¼ltiples orÌ_genes del MERS-CoV se deduce que el virus lleva muchos aÌ±os siendo residente en dromedarios, lo que concuerda con el hecho de que ya en los aÌ±os ochenta se detectaran anticuerpos anti-MERS-CoV en dromedarios.",NA,NA,transmission;genome,,MERS coronavirus,N,Article not accesible from UBC
First,27170381,2016,"Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)","Blum, Hubert E",History and Global Burden of Viral Hepatitis.,"Between 1963 and 1989, 5 hepatotropic viruses have been discovered that are the major causes of viral hepatitides worldwide: hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis delta virus and hepatitis E virus. Their epidemiology and pathogenesis have been studied in great detail. Furthermore, the structure and genetic organization of their DNA or RNA genome including the viral life cycle have been elucidated and have been successfully translated into important clinical applications, such as the specific diagnosis, therapy and prevention of the associated liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevalence of acute and chronic viral hepatitis A-E shows distinct geographic differences. The global burden of disease (prevalence, incidence, death, disability-adjusted life years) has been analyzed in seminal studies that show that the worldwide prevalence of hepatitis A-E has significantly decreased between 1990 and 2013. During the same time, the incidence of HBV-related liver cirrhosis and HCC, respectively, also decreased or increased slightly, the incidence of the HCV-related liver cirrhosis remained stable and the incidence of HCV-related HCC showed a major increase. During the coming years, we expect to improve our ability to prevent and effectively treat viral hepatitis A-E, resulting in the control of these global infections and the elimination of their associated morbidities and mortalities.",NA,NA,genome;cancer;geography,,Hepatitis B;Hepatitis C;Heptatis - General,N,not accessible from UBC

Viral and host factors are known to be predictors for antiviral therapy. Host factors that are predictors of sustained viral response (SVR) were discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near the interferon lambda gene (rs8099917, rs12979860 and rs368234815). The aim of the present study was to verify the genotype frequencies of SNPs rs8099917, rs12979860 and rs368234815 and to evaluate the association between SNPs and the outcome of HCV infection, taking into account the population ancestry. In this study, there was an association of the three polymorphisms with both clinical outcome and response to treatment with PEG-IFN and RBV. The polymorphisms rs12979860 and rs368234815 were associated with increased sensitivity (97.7åÊ%, 95åÊ% CI 87.2-100, and 93.3åÊ%, 95åÊ% CI 81.3-98.3; respectively) and with a greater predictive value of a positive response to treatment. In multivariable analysis adjusted by gender, age and ancestry, the haplotype G/T/ëÓG was related to non-response to treatment (OR = 21.09, 95åÊ% CI 5.33-83.51; p &lt; 0.001) and to a higher chance of developing chronic infection (OR = 5.46, 95åÊ% CI 2.06-14.46; p = 0.001) when compared to the haplotype T/C/TT. These findings may help to adjust our treatment policies for HCV infection based on greater certainty in studies with populations with such genetic characteristics, as well as allowing us to get to know the genetic profile of our population for these polymorphisms.",NA,NA,clinical;treatment;outcome;genome;cancer,,Hepatitis C,N,Article not accesible from UBC

The present study determined the proportion, geographic distribution and molecular characterization of hepatitis viruses among patients seeking medical services at hospitals throughout Kenya.METHODS: Patients presenting with jaundice at four selected hospitals were recruited (n = 389). Sera were tested for the presence of antibody to hepatitis viruses A through E, and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Nucleic acid from anti-HAV IgM antibody and HBsAg positive samples was extracted, amplified and sequenced.RESULTS: Chronic HBV infection was the leading cause of morbidity among patients with symptoms of liver disease seeking medical help. Incident HCV, HEV and HDV infection were not detected among the patients in this study, while the proportion of acute HAV was low; HAV IgM positivity was observed in 6.3 % of patients and sequencing revealed that all cases belonged to genotype 1B. HCV seropositivity upon initial screening was 3.9 % but none were confirmed positive by a supplementary immunoblot assay. There was no serological evidence of HDV and acute HEV infection (anti-HEV IgM). HBsAg was found in 50.6 % of the patients and 2.3 % were positive for IgM antibody to the core protein, indicating probable acute infection. HBV genotype A was predominant (90.3 %) followed by D (9.7 %) among HBV DNA positive specimens. Full genome analysis showed HBV/D isolates having similarity to both D4 and D6 subgenotypes and D/E recombinant reference sequences. Two recombinant sequences demonstrated &gt; 4 % nucleotide divergence from other previously known D/E recombinants.CONCLUSIONS: HBV is highly prevalent among patients seeking care for symptoms consistent with hepatitis, compared to the general population. Molecular characterization of HBV isolates indicated recombinant strains that may give rise to new circulating variants. There is a need to document the prevalence, clinical manifestation and distribution of the variants observed. HAV genotype 1B, prevalent in Africa, was observed; however, the absence of HCV, HDV and acute HEV in this study does not rule out their presence in Kenya.",PMC4774020,10.1186/s12879-016-1409-2,characterization;outbreak;international;genotype;cancer;clinical;diagnosis,,Hepatitis B,Y,

In 2014, a viremic patient who had recently visited the rainforests of Brunei returned to Australia displaying symptoms consistent with DENV infection. A unique DENV strain was subsequently isolated from the patient, which we propose belongs to a new genotype within DENV serotype 1 (DENV-1). Bayesian evolutionary phylogenetic analysis suggests that the putative sylvatic DENV-1 Brunei 2014 (Brun2014) is the most divergent DENV-1 yet recorded and increases the time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for DENV-1 from ‰äö120 years to ‰äö315 years. DENV-1 classification of the Brun2014 strain was further supported by monoclonal antibody serotyping data. Phenotypic characterization demonstrated that Brun2014 replication rates in mosquito cells and infection rates in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were not significantly different from an epidemic DENV-1 strain. Given its ability to cause human illness and infect Ae. aegypti, potential urban spillover and clinical disease from further Brun2014 transmission cannot be discounted.",PMC4770315,10.1038/srep22356,characterization;vector;clinical;diagnosis;phylogeny,,Dengue virus,Y,

Here, we investigated the intrahost genetic diversity in acute human samples collected at different time points during the DENV-3 epidemic that occurred in Cuba in 2001 to 2002 using a deep-sequencing approach.

CA-MRSA bacteria are much less prevalent in Europe, where the European ST80-IV European CA-MRSA clone, USA300 CA-MRSA strains, and other lineages, such as ST22-IV, coexist. The question that arises is whether the USA300 CA-MRSA present in Europe (i) was imported once or on very few occasions, followed by a broad geographic spread, anticipating an increased prevalence in the future, or (ii) derived from multiple importations with limited spreading success.

Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the population structure of the French isolates is the product of multiple introductions dating back to the onset of the USA300 CA-MRSA clone in North America.

We determined that the French CA-MRSA USA300 sporadic and micro-outbreak isolates resulted from multiple independent introductions of the USA300 North American lineage. At a global level, in the transition from an MSSA lineage to a successful CA-MRSA clone, it first became resistant to multiple antibiotics and acquired the arginine catabolic mobile element and subsequently acquired resistance to fluoroquinolones, and these two steps were associated with a dramatic demographic expansion. This expansion was followed by the current stabilization and expected decline of this lineage.

Isolates with high levels of resistance to aminoglycosides carried the 16S rRNA methylase armA gene. The isolates also carried a variety of genes encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Several novel structures involved in aminoglycoside resistance were identified, including Tn6279, ëÓTn6279, Ab-ST3-aadB, and different assemblies of Tn6020 and TnaphA6.

Helicobacter pylori infection is the strongest known risk factor for this malignancy. An important goal is to identify H.åÊpylori-infected persons at high risk for gastric cancer, so that these individuals can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. H.åÊpylori exhibits a high level of intraspecies genetic diversity, and over the past two decades, many studies have endeavored to identify strain-specific features of H.åÊpylori that are linked to development of gastric cancer. One of the most prominent differences among H.åÊpylori strains is the presence or absence of a 40-kb chromosomal region known as the cag pathogenicity island (PAI). Current evidence suggests that the risk of gastric cancer is very low among persons harboring H.åÊpylori strains that lack the cag PAI. Among persons harboring strains that contain the cag PAI, the risk of gastric cancer is shaped by a complex interplay among multiple strain-specific bacterial factors as well as host factors.

To investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of AIVs in different ecological contexts, we surveyed AIVs in live poultry markets (LPMs), free-range poultry and the wetland habitats of wild birds in Zhejiang and Hubei provinces. Notably, LPMs contained the highest frequency of AIV infection, and the greatest number of subtypes (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä9) and subtype co-infections (n‰Ûä=‰Ûä14), as well as frequent reassortment, suggesting that they play an active role in fuelling AIV transmission. AIV-positive samples were also identified in wild birds in both provinces and free-range poultry in one sampling site close to a wetland region in Hubei. H9N2, H7N9 and H5N1 were the most commonly sampled subtypes in the LPMs from Zhejiang, whilst H5N6 and H9N2 were the dominant subtypes in the LPMs from Hubei. Phylogenetic analyses of the whole-genome sequences of 43 AIVs revealed that three reassortant H5 subtypes were circulating in LMPs in both geographical regions. Notably, the viruses sampled from the wetland regions and free-range poultry contained complex reassortants, for which the origins of some segments were unclear. Overall, our study highlights the extent of AIV genetic diversity in two highly populated parts of central and south-eastern China, particularly in LPMs, and emphasizes the need for continual surveillance.",NA,NA,surveillance;genome;diversity;clinical;diagnosis;outbreak;phylogeny,,Haemophilus Influenza,M,"spread among birds, very common visualization type"

This plasmid contains a genomic island with sequence similar to islands found in chromosomes of virulent P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. The objective of this work was to determine whether pUM505 increases the virulence of P. aeruginosa and to identify the genes responsible for this property. First, using the lettuce-leaf model, we found that pUM505 significantly increases the virulence of P. aeruginosa reference strain PAO1. pUM505 also increased the PAO1 virulence in a murine model and increased cytotoxicity of this strain toward HeLa cells. Thus, we generated a pUM505 gene library of 103 clones in the pUCP20 binary vector. The library was transferred to Escherichia coli TOP10 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 to identify genes. The lettuce-leaf model allowed us to identify three recombinant plasmids that increased the virulence of both E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains. These recombinant plasmids also increased the virulence of the PAO1 strain in mice and induced a cytotoxic effect in HeLa cells. Eleven genes were identified in the virulent transformants. Of these genes, only the pUM505 ORF 2 has homology with a gene previously implicated in virulence. These results indicate that pUM505 contains several genes that encode virulence factors, suggesting that the plasmid may contribute directly to bacterial virulence.",NA,NA,drug resistance;genome;characterization,,Escherichia coli;Pseudomona aeruginosa,N,"lab technique, not genEpi"

At present, questions remain about the transmission of LA-MRSA to the general human population through pork. The objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence of LA-MRSA in Belgian pork and to determine the role of the pork production chain and butcheries in transmission of LA-MRSA to the human population. Pig meat samples (chops, bacon, minced pork, ribs, forelimbs, and ears; n = 137) originating from four butcheries (A through D) were spread plated on ChromID MRSA plates both before and after overnight enrichment culture. Suspect colonies were confirmed using a MRSA-specific triplex PCR assay and a CC398-specific PCR assay. The isolates (n = 147) were further characterized by SCCmec typing, multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, a selection of isolates were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and spa typing. Direct plating revealed a MRSA prevalence of 8%. After enrichment, MRSA was isolated from 98 (72%) of 137 samples of which the majority were from rib, ear, and forelimb. The majority (97%) of obtained isolates belonged to CC398, the main LA-MRSA type. A high level of genetic diversity was noted among the isolates from one butchery. Thirty antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were found; 13 and 9% of the isolates had Cip-Tet-Tri and Gen-Kan-Tet-Tob-Tri profiles, respectively. These results indicate the importance of enrichment for MRSA detection of pork. The observed genetic diversity of the isolates indicated that the pork production chain can be considered a source of multiple MRSA types that could be transmitted to the human population through cross-contaminated meat.",NA,NA,drug resistance;clinical;treatment;genome;diversity;genotype;mBio,drug resistance;genome;,Staphylococcus aureus,M,"not about human, but interesting"

The strongest signal of association was observed in the HLA class I region that was fully explained by independent effects mapping to five variable amino acid positions in the peptide binding grooves of the HLA-B and HLA-A proteins. We observed a second genome-wide significant association signal in the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor (CCR) gene cluster on chromosome 3. Conditional analysis showed that this signal could not be fully attributed to the known protective CCR5ëÓ32 allele and the risk P1 haplotype, suggesting further causal variants in this region.

However, data analysis and interlaboratory comparability of WGS data are still challenging for most public health laboratories. Therefore, we have developed and evaluated a new L. monocytogenes typing scheme based on genome-wide gene-by-gene comparisons (core genome multilocus the sequence typing [cgMLST]) to allow for a unique typing nomenclature. Initially, we determined the breadth of the L. monocytogenes population based on MLST data with a Bayesian approach. Based on the genome sequence data of representative isolates for the whole population, cgMLST target genes were defined and reappraised with 67 L. monocytogenes isolates from two outbreaks and serotype reference strains. The Bayesian population analysis generated five L. monocytogenes groups. Using all available NCBI RefSeq genomes (n = 36) and six additionally sequenced strains, all genetic groups were covered. Pairwise comparisons of these 42 genome sequences resulted in 1,701 cgMLST targets present in all 42 genomes with 100% overlap and ‰ä´90% sequence similarity.

Antibiotic resistance means that the identification of novel E. faecalis and E. faecium phages against antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus have an important impact on public health. In this study, the E. faecalis phage IME-EF4, E. faecium phage IME-EFm1, and both their hosts were antibiotic resistant. To characterize the genome termini of these two phages, a termini analysis theory was developed to provide a wealth of terminal sequence information directly, using only high-throughput sequencing (HTS) read frequency statistics.RESULTS: The complete genome sequences of phages IME-EF4 and IME-EFm1 were determined, and our termini analysis theory was used to determine the genome termini of these two phages. Results showed 9 bp 3' protruding cohesive ends in both IME-EF4 and IME-EFm1 genomes by analyzing frequencies of HTS reads. For the positive strands of their genomes, the 9 nt 3' protruding cohesive ends are 5'-TCATCACCG-3' (IME-EF4) and 5'-GGGTCAGCG-3' (IME-EFm1). Further experiments confirmed these results. These experiments included mega-primer polymerase chain reaction sequencing, terminal run-off sequencing, and adaptor ligation followed by run-off sequencing.CONCLUSION: Using this termini analysis theory, the termini of two newly isolated antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus phages, IME-EF4 and IME-EFm1, were identified as the byproduct of HTS. Molecular biology experiments confirmed the identification. Because it does not require time-consuming wet lab termini analysis experiments, the termini analysis theory is a fast and easy means of identifying phage DNA genome termini using HTS read frequency statistics alone.

Descriptive epidemiology indicated that a continuous transmission from person to person was most likely. Results from the cohort study showed that 'frequent manipulation' (a proxy for increased exposure to medical procedures) was significantly associated with being a case (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.19). Genome sequences revealed that all 48 bacterial isolates available for sequencing from 31 cases were closely related (maximum genetic distance, 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms). Based on our calculation of evolutionary rate and sequence diversity, we estimate that the outbreak strain was endemic since 2008.CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses consistently indicated that there were additional, undiscovered cases prior to the onset of microbiological screening and that the spread of the pathogen remained undetected over several years, driven predominantly by person-to-person transmission.

We sequenced the genomes of 16 E. coli colonies from each of eight fecal samples (n = 127 genomes; one failure), taken from different individuals in Cambodia, a region of high ESBL-producing E. coli prevalence. Sequence data were used to characterize both the core chromosomal diversity of E. coli isolates and their resistance/virulence gene content as a proxy measure of accessory genome diversity. The 127 E. coli genomes represented 31 distinct sequence types (STs). Seven (88%) of eight subjects carried ESBL-positive isolates, all containing blaCTX-M variants. Diversity was substantial, with a median of four STs/individual (range, 1 to 10) and wide genetic divergence at the nucleotide level within some STs. In 2/8 (25%) individuals, the same blaCTX-M variant occurred in different clones, and/or different blaCTX-M variants occurred in the same clone. Patterns of other resistance genes and common virulence factors, representing differences in the accessory genome, were also diverse within and between clones. The substantial diversity among intestinally carried ESBL-positive E. coli bacteria suggests that fecal surveillance, particularly if based on single-colony subcultures, will likely underestimate transmission events, especially in high-prevalence settings.",PMC4473215,10.1128/JCM.00378-15,drug resistance;genome;diversity,drug resistance;genome;diversity;transmission,Escherichia coli,Y,

One example is Singapore, where MRSA ST239, the dominant clone since molecular profiling of MRSA began in the mid-1980s, has been replaced by ST22 isolates belonging to EMRSA-15, a recently emerged pandemic lineage originating from Europe.RESULTS: We investigated the population structure of MRSA in Singaporean hospitals spanning three decades, using whole genome sequencing. Applying Bayesian phylogenetic methods we report that prior to the introduction of ST22, the ST239 MRSA population in Singapore originated from multiple introductions from the surrounding region; it was frequently transferred within the healthcare system resulting in a heterogeneous hospital population. Following the introduction of ST22 around the beginning of the millennium, this clone spread rapidly through Singaporean hospitals, supplanting the endemic ST239 population. Coalescent analysis revealed that although the genetic diversity of ST239 initially decreased as ST22 became more dominant, from 2007 onwards the genetic diversity of ST239 began to increase once more, which was not associated with the emergence of a sub-clone of ST239. Comparative genomic analysis of the accessory genome of the extant ST239 population identified that the Arginine Catabolic Mobile Element arose multiple times, thereby introducing genes associated with enhanced skin colonization into this population.CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly demonstrate that, alongside clinical practice and antibiotic usage, competition between clones also has an important role in driving the evolution of nosocomial pathogen populations.",PMC4407387,10.1186/s13059-015-0643-z,drug resistance;genome;diversity;mBio,drug resistance;genome;diversity;mBio;hospital;geography,Staphylococcus aureus,Y,

All suspected cases were screened for respiratory viruses using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs. Infection control procedures (droplet precautions with single room isolation whenever possible) were implemented for all suspected or confirmed cases. Specimens positive for influenza viruses were processed and sequenced whenever possible to track transmission dynamics.RESULTS: Respiratory samples from 155 suspected cases were analyzed during the outbreak period, of which 69 (44%) were positive for influenza virus, 26 (17%) were positive for other respiratory viruses, and 60 (39%) were negative. Three other cases fulfilled clinical criteria for influenza infection but were not sampled, and one individual was admitted with an already positive test, resulting in a total of 73 influenza cases, of which 62 (85%) were classified as nosocomial. Five distinct clusters of nosocomial transmission were identified using viral sequencing, with epidemiologically unexpected in-hospital transmission dynamics. Seven of 23 patients who experienced influenza complications died. Sixteen healthcare workers experienced an influenza-like illness (overall vaccination rate, 36%).CONCLUSION: Nosocomial influenza transmission caused more secondary cases than repeated community importation during this polyclonal outbreak. Molecular tools revealed complex transmission dynamics. Low healthcare worker vaccination rates and gaps in recommended infection control procedures are likely to have contributed to nosocomial spread of influenza, which remains a potentially life-threatening disease in elderly adults.",NA,NA,outbreak;mBio,,Haemophilus Influenza,Y,

We aimed to investigate the association between enterovirus D68 infection and acute flaccid myelitis during the 2014 enterovirus D68 respiratory outbreak in the USA.METHODS: Patients with acute flaccid myelitis who presented to two hospitals in Colorado and California, USA, between Nov 24, 2013, and Oct 11, 2014, were included in the study. Additional cases identified from Jan 1, 2012, to Oct 4, 2014, via statewide surveillance were provided by the California Department of Public Health. We investigated the cause of these cases by metagenomic next-generation sequencing, viral genome recovery, and enterovirus D68 phylogenetic analysis. We compared patients with acute flaccid myelitis who were positive for enterovirus D68 with those with acute flaccid myelitis but negative for enterovirus D68 using the two-tailed Fisher's exact test, two-sample unpaired t test, and Mann-Whitney U test.FINDINGS: 48 patients were included: 25 with acute flaccid myelitis, two with enterovirus-associated encephalitis, five with enterovirus-D68-associated upper respiratory illness, and 16 with aseptic meningitis or encephalitis who tested positive for enterovirus. Enterovirus D68 was detected in respiratory secretions from seven (64%) of 11 patients comprising two temporally and geographically linked acute flaccid myelitis clusters at the height of the 2014 outbreak, and from 12 (48%) of 25 patients with acute flaccid myelitis overall. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all enterovirus D68 sequences associated with acute flaccid myelitis grouped into a clade B1 strain that emerged in 2010. Of six coding polymorphisms in the clade B1 enterovirus D68 polyprotein, five were present in neuropathogenic poliovirus or enterovirus D70, or both. One child with acute flaccid myelitis and a sibling with only upper respiratory illness were both infected by identical enterovirus D68 strains. Enterovirus D68 viraemia was identified in a child experiencing acute neurological progression of his paralytic illness. Deep metagenomic sequencing of cerebrospinal fluid from 14 patients with acute flaccid myelitis did not reveal evidence of an alternative infectious cause to enterovirus D68.INTERPRETATION: These findings strengthen the putative association between enterovirus D68 and acute flaccid myelitis and the contention that acute flaccid myelitis is a rare yet severe clinical manifestation of enterovirus D68 infection in susceptible hosts.FUNDING: National Institutes of Health, University of California, Abbott Laboratories, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",NA,NA,control;genome;phylogeny;diversity,,Microbiota; Enterovirus D68,Y,

The resistance to other antibiotics was high. Most of the pathogens were isolated from the urinary tract (86.44%). Carbapenems were the most effective antimicrobial agents followed by amikacin and fosfomycin. The rate of blaSHV, blaTEM, and blaCTX-M genes among the isolates was 89, 56.78, and 81.35%, respectively.

This study, the first to investigate the evolutionary response of hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) over many decades, demonstrates how MRSA can persist in a region through the reintroduction of a previously unrecognized distinct clade. This study also demonstrates the crucial adaptive responses of HA-MRSA to the highly selective environment of the health care system, the evolution of MRSA isolates to even higher levels of antibiotic resistance at the cost of attenuated virulence. However, in vivo persistence is maintained, resulting in a clone of HA-MRSA able to resist almost all antimicrobial agents and still cause invasive disease in the heavily compromised hosts found in modern health care settings.",PMC4358018,10.1128/mBio.00080-15,drug resistance;genome;diversity;outbreak;hospital,,Staphylococcus aureus,Y,

In this study, we assessed the genomic profile aiming at identifying potential prognostic biomarkers in penile carcinoma. Globally, 46 penile carcinoma samples were considered to evaluate DNA copy-number alterations via array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) combined with human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping. Specific genes were investigated by using qPCR, FISH, and RT-qPCR. Genomic alterations mapped at 3p and 8p were related to worse prognostic features, including advanced T and clinical stage, recurrence and death from the disease. Losses of 3p21.1-p14.3 and gains of 3q25.31-q29 were associated with reduced cancer-specific and disease-free survival. Genomic alterations detected for chromosome 3 (LAMP3, PPARG, TNFSF10 genes) and 8 (DLC1) were evaluated by qPCR. DLC1 and PPARG losses were associated with poor prognosis characteristics. Losses of DLC1 were an independent risk factor for recurrence on multivariate analysis. The gene-expression analysis showed downexpression of DLC1 and PPARG and overexpression of LAMP3 and TNFSF10 genes. Chromosome Y losses and MYC gene (8q24) gains were confirmed by FISH.

Detailed clinical information was obtained for all laboratory-confirmed MenW cases diagnosed during 3 epidemiologic years (2010-2011 to 2012-2013), alongside whole-genome sequencing analysis of the clinical isolates.RESULTS: The year-on-year increase in invasive MenW disease across all age groups since 2009-2010 was due to rapid endemic expansion of a single clone belonging to the sequence type 11 complex (cc11). In 2013-2014, MenW was responsible for 15% of all invasive meningococcal disease. All but 1 of the recent MenW:cc11 isolates were very closely related, consistent with recent clonal expansion. Clinical follow-up of all 129 MenW cases diagnosed during 2010-2011 to 2012-2013 revealed that most patients were previously healthy (n = 105 [81%]), had not travelled abroad prior to illness and the majority presented with septicemia (n = 63 [49%]), meningitis (n = 16 [12%]) or both (n = 21 [16%]); however, one-quarter had atypical presentations including pneumonia (n = 15 [12%]), septic arthritis (n = 9 [7%]), and epiglottitis/supraglottitis (n = 5 [4%]).

Clinical and social data were retrospectively collected.RESULTS: We identified 68 patients associated with the outbreak strain. Most received a tuberculosis diagnosis in 1991-1995, but cases were observed until 2011. Two thirds were homeless and/or substance abusers. Targeted WGS revealed 133 variable SNP positions among outbreak isolates. Genomic network analyses suggested a single origin of the outbreak, with subsequent division into 3 subclusters. Isolates from patients with confirmed epidemiological links differed by 0-11 SNPs.CONCLUSIONS: Strain-specific SNP genotyping allowed rapid and inexpensive identification of M. tuberculosis outbreak isolates in a population-based strain collection.

Incidence of both type-1 and type-2 diabetes has increased during the past decades, suggesting that there have been changes in the interactions between predisposing genetic and environmental factors. Animal studies show that gut microbiota and its genome (microbiome) influence alterations in energy balance (increased energy harvest) and immunity (inflammation and autoimmunity), leading to metabolic dysfunction (e.g., insulin resistance and deficiency). Thus, although they have different origins, both disorders are linked by the association of the gut microbiota with the immune-metabolic axis. Human studies have also revealed shifts in microbiome signatures in diseased subjects as compared with controls, and a few of them precede the development of these disorders.

Indeed, by the late-1950s, it was becoming common belief that most human and veterinary pathogenic viruses had been discovered. However, at that time, knowledge of the impact of improved commercial transportation, urbanisation and deforestation, on disease emergence, was in its infancy. From the late 1960s onwards viruses, such as hepatitis virus (A, B and C) hantavirus, HIV, Marburg virus, Ebola virus and many others began to emerge and it became apparent that the world was changing, at least in terms of virus epidemiology, largely due to the influence of anthropological activities. Subsequently, with the improvement of molecular biotechnologies, for amplification of viral RNA, genome sequencing and proteomic analysis the arsenal of available tools for virus discovery and genetic characterization opened up new and exciting possibilities for virological discovery. Many recently identified but &quot;unclassified&quot; viruses are now being allocated to existing genera or families based on whole genome sequencing, bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis. New species, genera and families are also being created following the guidelines of the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses. Many of these newly discovered viruses are vectored by arthropods (arboviruses) and possess an RNA genome. This brief review will focus largely on the discovery of new arthropod-borne viruses.",NA,NA,genome;vector;phylogeny,,Ebola virus (many),N,no figures

Molecular typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates has greatly facilitated to understand the transmission of TB. This study was aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of M. tuberculosis genotypes in Varanasi, north India, and their association with clinical presentation among patients with pulmonary TB.METHODS: M. tuberculosis isolates from 104 TB patients attending a tertiary referral hospital of north India were screened for susceptibility to isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB) and streptomycin (STR) by proportion method and multiplex-allele-specific-polymerase chain reaction (MAS-PCR). These were genotyped by spoligotyping. The spoligotype patterns were compared with those in the international SITVIT2 spoligotyping database.RESULTS: Eighty three of 104 isolates were distributed in 38 SITs, of which SIT3366 was newly created within the present study. The mass of ongoing transmission with MDR-TB isolates in Varanasi, northern India, was linked to Beijing genotype followed by the CAS1_Delhi lineage. HIV-seropositive patients had a significantly higher proportion of clustered isolates than HIV-seronegative patients and compared with the wild type(wt) isolates, the isolates with katG315Thr mutation were considerably more likely to be clustered.INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSIONS: This study gives an insight into the M. tuberculosis genetic biodiversity in Varanasi, north India, the predominant spoligotypes and their impact on disease transmission. In this region of north India, TB is caused by a wide diversity of spoligotypes with predominance of four genotype lineages: Beijing, CAS, EAI and T.

The four most discriminative VNTRs were selected for further MLVA analysis. The discriminatory power was evaluated on 272 veterinary and human isolates plus 29 outbreak-related isolates. MLVA divided the 272 isolates into 103 types and successfully identified isolates from an epidemiologically confirmed outbreak. VNTRs exhibited 100% in vitro stability and contained only true repeats. The discriminatory power of the MLVA was compared to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). When analysing a subset of 106 isolates, MLVA obtained 60 types (index of diversity (DI) of 0åá97), while PFGE revealed 10 types (DI of 0åá57).CONCLUSIONS: The technique showed a significantly enhanced discriminatory power compared with the current 'gold standard' PFGE.

HCV is classified into seven phylogenetically distinct genotypes, which have different geographical distributions and levels of genetic diversity. Some of these genotypes are endemic and highly divergent, whereas others disseminate rapidly on an epidemic scale but display lower variability. HCV phylogeny has an important impact on disease epidemiology and clinical practice because the viral genotype may determine the pathogenesis and severity of the resultant chronic liver disease. In addition, there is a clear association between the HCV genotype and its susceptibility to antiviral treatment. Similarly to other RNA viruses, in a single host, HCV exists as a combination of related but genetically different variants. The whole formation is the actual target of selection exerted by a host organism and antiviral therapeutics. The genetic structure of the viral population is largely shaped by mutations that are constantly introduced during an error-prone replication. However, it appears that genetic recombination may also contribute to this process. This heterogeneous collection of variants has a significant ability to evolve towards the fitness optimum. Interestingly, negative selection, which restricts diversity, emerges as an essential force that drives HCV evolution.

Of these, 339 were tested for susceptibility to four first-line anti-TB drugs, including isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP), streptomycin (SM), and ethambutol (EMB), using the proportion method. A pyrazinamidase (PZase) test was used to assess pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance. Results of the culture-based drug susceptibility tests were confirmed by those from reverse hybridization-based line probe assays (LiPAs) that detected mutations associated with RMP, INH, PZA, and fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance. To investigate a diversity of these strains, IS6110-probed restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were analyzed. Nucleotide sequences for furA-katG and fabG1-inhA operons, transcription units responsible for INH resistance, were also determined.RESULTS: Of the isolates tested, 127 (37.5%) were resistant to at least one of the four drugs, which included 93 (27.4%) isolates that were resistant to INH. RFLP analysis identified four clusters defined by similarity of the band patterns, which accounted for 46.1% of the tested isolates. Among the clustered isolates, 37.7% were resistant to INH, most of which (85.4%) carried a g944c mutation, which causes an S315T amino acid substitution, in the katG gene.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that drug-resistant strains, particularly those with INH resistance characterized by a single mutation, S315T, are spreading in Hanoi, Vietnam. When RMP resistance is combined with this setting, patients are not easily cured by conventional short-term treatment. We will need to carefully monitor these trends and search for the origins and transmission routes of these strains.",PMC4228276,10.1186/1756-0500-6-444,genotype;clinical;treatment;outbreak;drug resistance;characterization;mBio,,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,N,no figures

It is expanding its borders over time and the associated economic and health consequences are critically important. To determine the evolutionary history and phylodynamics of HPAI H5N1, a comprehensive analysis of the demographic, adaptive and spatial dynamics of H5N1 viruses in China over almost two decades based on whole genome sequences was performed. We divided HPAI H5N1 isolates into five and seven distinct groups for HA and NA respectively, and several regionally dominant subgroups were found as well. We detected five reassortants, and our analysis suggested that the intrasubtype reassortment may resulted in enhanced virulence. Seven and eight positively selected sites were detected in HA and NA genes respectively, and the relatively higher dN/dS ratio and nucleotide substitution rate were observed in NS gene. Our BSP analysis about the effective population size increase and decrease showed similar temporal patterns to those in the epidemiological studies. Here we show that the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of earlier reassortments was dated back to 1970s. And our phylogeographic analysis indicated that the geographic spread of HPAI H5N1 accelerated the viral evolution and expanded their host ranges, prompting potential cross-species transmission.",NA,NA,clinical;vector;transmission;genome;phylogeny,,Haemophilus Influenza,Y,"note: not wgs, sequence gene region, but multiple hosts (human & animal("

All parents or legal guardians of individuals younger than 18 years provided informed written consent for participation. The corresponding written permission from all municipal authorities was obtained from each city or town where subjects were to be included. HCV RNA reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. The 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) was used for RNA detection and initial genotype classification. The NS5B polymerase region, encompassing nt 8262-8610, was used for subtyping.RESULTS: An unexpectedly low prevalence of HCV infection in the general population (0.32%) was observed. Our data contrasted with previous studies that reported rates ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%, mainly performed in selected populations of blood donors or vulnerable groups. The latter values are in keeping with the prevalence reported by the 2007 Argentinian HCV Consensus (approximately 2%). HCV subtypes were distributed as follows: 1a (25%), 1b (25%), 2c (25%), 3a (5%), and 2j (5%). Two isolates ascribed either to genotype 1 (5%) or to genotype 3 (5%) by 5'UTR phylogenetic analysis could not be subtyped. Subtype 1a sequences comprised a highly homogeneous population and clustered with United States sequences. Genotype 1b sequences represented a heterogeneous population, suggesting that this genotype might have been introduced from different sources. Most subtype 2c sequences clustered close to the 2c reported from Italy and Southern France.CONCLUSION: HCV has a low prevalence of 0.32% in the studied general population of Argentina.

Genotyping was performed using the genotype specific core primers in nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 5' non-coding regions based PCR- restriction fragment length polymorphism and NS5B sequencing methods. With the latter method, obtained sequences were compared with published GenBank sequences to determine the genotype.RESULTS: Of the 451 samples tested, HCV genotype 3 was found to be the most predominant (63.85%).

An approach based on viral metagenomics was used to study gut specimens from 78 insectivorous bats in Yunnan Province, China. Seventy-four reads were found to be related to group A rotavirus (RVA). Further reverse transcription-PCR screening and viral isolation on cell cultures confirmed the presence of a novel RVA strain, named RVA/Bat-tc/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3], in 1 (6%) of 16 lesser horseshoe bats. Full genomic sequencing analyses showed that MSLH14 possessed the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I8-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which is akin to human and animal rotaviruses believed to be of feline/canine origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VP7 was most closely related to bovine RVA strains from India, whereas VP4 was most closely related to an unusual human RVA strain, CMH222, with animal characteristics isolated in Thailand. The remaining gene segments were only distantly related to a range of animal RVA strains, most of which are believed to be related to feline/canine RVAs. Experimental infection showed that bat RVA strain MSLH14 was highly pathogenic to suckling mice, causing 100% mortality when they were inoculated orally with a titer as low as 5 ÌÑ 10å_ 50% tissue culture infective doses. As this virus is not closely related to any known RVA strain, it is tempting to speculate that it is a true bat RVA strain rather than a virus transmitted between species.

This phenomenon may be caused by reasons such as cross-infection from neighboring patients that switches to different A. baumannii strain, natural mutation of A. baumannii, inducing of different antibiotic resistance genes expression or acquisition of genes conferring resistance from another source. To elucidate this question, clinical A. baumannii strains, isolated from the same individual patients, showed antibiotic resistance phenotypes switching during the same hospitalization period, were attentively collected for further analysis. Molecular approaches for phylogenetic analysis, including pulsed field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and short tandem repeat analysis, were employed for the chronological studies.FINDINGS: Our results showed that antibiotic resistance phenotype switching could have occurred as a result through both cross-infection and natural mutation roots. Our results also suggest that rapid phenotype switching between paired isolates could occur during one single course of antibiotic treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Though cross infection caused antibiotic resistance phenotype switching does occur, natural mutation of A. baumannii isolates is particularly cautious for antibiotic treatment.",PMC3851446,10.1186/1476-0711-12-21,drug resistance;genotype;characterization,,Acinetobact baumannii,N,no figures

Large amounts of health care funding are spent trying to control antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitals globally, yet in many institutions around the world, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREfm) infections continue to rise. The new findings from this study help explain the failures of our current approaches to controlling vanB VREfm in health care institutions. Given the importance of this bacterium as a cause of hospital-acquired infections and the difficulties faced by infection control units in trying to prevent colonization in their institutions, the novel findings from this study provide evidence that a new approach to controlling VREfm in hospitals is required. In particular, more attention should be given to understanding the epidemiology of hospital-adapted vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium, and patients at higher risk for de novo generation of VREfm need to be identified and optimally managed.",PMC3747580,10.1128/mBio.00412-13,control;drug resistance;mBio;genome,,Enterococcus faecium,Y,

The precision of evolutionary estimates of epidemic history can be increased by the inclusion of sequences derived from 'archived' samples that are genetically distinct from contemporary strains. Historical sequences are especially valuable for viral pathogens that circulated for many years before being formally identified, including HIV and the hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, surprisingly few HCV isolates sampled before discovery of the virus in 1989 are currently available. Here, we report and analyse two HCV subgenomic sequences obtained from infected individuals in 1953, which represent the oldest genetic evidence of HCV infection. The pairwise genetic diversity between the two sequences indicates a substantial period of HCV transmission prior to the 1950s, and their inclusion in evolutionary analyses provides new estimates of the common ancestor of HCV in the USA. To explore and validate the evolutionary information provided by these sequences, we used a new phylogenetic molecular clock method to estimate the date of sampling of the archived strains, plus the dates of four more contemporary reference genomes. Despite the short fragments available, we conclude that the archived sequences are consistent with a proposed sampling date of 1953, although statistical uncertainty is large. Our cross-validation analyses suggest that the bias and low statistical power observed here likely arise from a combination of high evolutionary rate heterogeneity and an unstructured, star-like phylogeny. We expect that attempts to date other historical viruses under similar circumstances will meet similar problems.",PMC3758194,10.1098/rstb.2013.0168,transmission;genome;diversity,transmission;genome;outbreak;hospital,Hepatitis C,M,"no wgs, some interesting  figures"

For 36/60 cervical samples genotyping results using NGS and Luminex were identical. For 12/60 samples the NGS method was more sensitive than the Luminex test and most of the remaining discrepancies could be explained by the different type coverage of the assays.

Martinique has been at a crossroads between Africa, Europe, India and the Americas because of the slave trade (17th-19th centuries), followed by an important immigration of Indian and West African workers. In this work, we aimed to study the molecular epidemiology of HBV infection in Martinique according to this unique settlement pattern. To that end, blood samples from 86 consecutive HBV-infected patients from the main hospitals of the island, were retrospectively analysed. Direct sequencing of the pre-S1 or pre-C-C region or complete genome sequencing, followed by phylogenetic analyses were performed. HBV genotypes were: HBV/A1 (68.6‰Û_%), HBV/A2 (10.5‰Û_%), HBV/D, mainly HBV/D3 and HBV/D4 (8.1‰Û_%), HBV/F (3.5‰Û_%), and also HBV/E (2.3‰Û_%), two strains isolated from two West-African patients. Moreover, 74‰Û_% of the HBeAg-negative strains harboured classical pre-C-C mutations, and most HBV/A1 strains also containing specific mutations. Finally, various patterns of deletion mutants in pre-S and pre-C-C regions were found. In conclusion, our findings point to historical and migration-related issues in HBV-genotype distribution suggesting that HBV/A1, but not HBV/E, was imported from Africa during the slave trade, and further supporting the hypothesis that HBV/E has emerged recently in West Africa (&lt;150 years). Potential origins of 'European' HBV/A2 and HBV/D3, 'Amerindian' HBV/F, and HBV/D4 strains are also discussed.

Recent genetic information has indicated that populations of E. coli O157 from cattle and humans can differ genetically and that this variation may have an impact on their ability to cause severe human disease. In addition, there is emerging evidence that E. coli O157 strains from different geographical regions may also be genetically divergent. To investigate the extent of this variation, we used Shiga toxin bacteriophage insertion sites (SBI), lineage-specific polymorphisms (LSPA-6), multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA), and a tir 255T&gt;A polymorphism to examine 606 isolates representing both Australian and U.S. cattle and human populations. Both uni- and multivariate analyses of these data show a strong association between the country of origin and multilocus genotypes (P &lt; 0.0001).

Unique cases with isolation of ESBL-producing E. coli from February 2010 through July 2011 were analyzed by PCR for blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and blaSHV genes. Patients with CTX-M E. coli were compared to patients with E. coli strains not producing CTX-M-type ESBLs (non-CTX-M E. coli) and uninfected controls. Of 575 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli, 491 (85.4%) isolates contained a CTX-M ESBL gene. A total of 319 (84.6%) patients with CTX-M E. coli (282 [74.8%] CTX-M-15 type) were compared to 58 (15.4%) non-CTX-M E. coli patients and to uninfected controls. Independent risk factors for CTX-M E. coli isolation compared to non-CTX-M E. coli included male gender, impaired consciousness, H2 blocker use, immunosuppression, and exposure to penicillins and/or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Compared to uninfected controls, independent risk factors for isolation of CTX-M E. coli included presence of a urinary catheter, previous urinary tract infection, exposure to oxyimino-cephalosporins, dependent functional status, non-home residence, and multiple comorbid conditions. Within 48 h of admission, community-acquired CTX-M E. coli (n = 51 [16%]) and non-CTX-M E coli (n = 11 [19%]) strains were isolated from patients with no recent health care contacts. CTX-M E. coli strains were more resistant to multiple antibiotics than non-CTX-M E. coli strains. CTX-M-encoding genes, especially bla(CTX-M-15) type, represented the most common ESBL determinants from ESBL-producing E. coli, the majority of which were present upon admission.

Previous FIV prevalence studies have relied on convenience sampling strategies, leaving out an important group of pet cats that do not receive regular veterinary attention. Saliva was selected for testing because collection was non-invasive and was likely to achieve a high rate of participation. Ninety-six cats were surveyed and tested for salivary antibodies against FIV and with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was considered to be the gold standard and a cat was considered to be FIV-positive if sequencing results on a PCR product of appropriate size matched previously published FIV genome sequences available in GenBank. Results showed 10/96 cats to be infected with FIV subtype A, indicating a prevalence of 10.4% (95% confidence interval: 4.4-16.4) in the area studied.

Statistical models that combine known risk factors for T2D can partly identify individuals at high risk of developing the disease. However, these studies have so far indicated that human genetics contributes little to the models, whereas socio-demographic and environmental factors have greater influence. Recent evidence suggests the importance of the gut microbiota as an environmental factor, and an altered gut microbiota has been linked to metabolic diseases including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Here we use shotgun sequencing to characterize the faecal metagenome of 145 European women with normal, impaired or diabetic glucose control. We observe compositional and functional alterations in the metagenomes of women with T2D, and develop a mathematical model based on metagenomic profiles that identified T2D with high accuracy. We applied this model to women with impaired glucose tolerance, and show that it can identify women who have a diabetes-like metabolism. Furthermore, glucose control and medication were unlikely to have major confounding effects. We also applied our model to a recently described Chinese cohort and show that the discriminant metagenomic markers for T2D differ between the European and Chinese cohorts.

The increase in antibiotic resistance and transfer of antibiotic resistance gene to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) due to co-colonization has increased its importance in research. The aim of the study was to evaluate local epidemiology of nasal and rectal colonization with Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) in patients of Paediatrics Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and correlation with clinical and socioeconomic factors.METHODS: The nasal and perirectal swab samples were collected from 110 patients admitted in PICUs of three tertiary care hospitals of Rawalpindi Medical College, Pakistan. The identification of enterococci was done by biochemical tests and by PCR for ddl, vanA and vanB genes. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion and MICs were determined for vancomycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and oxacillin only.RESULTS: Out of 220 nasal and perirectal samples, 09 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and 76 vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), consisting of 40 E. faecalis and 45 E. faecium were isolated. PCR successfully identified both species with ddl primers and VRE with vanA primer. With disc diffusion method, all isolates were resistant to most of the antibiotics tested except linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin and vancomycin. VRE showed resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin both and none was resistant to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Generally, E. faecium isolates were more resistant than E. faecalis. MICs of vancomycin for nasal and perirectal VRE were 512 mg/L and 64 to 512 mg/L respectively. VRE were more in patients with prolonged hospitalization, from urban localities and those having pneumonia.CONCLUSION: Present study reveals high colonization and antibiotic resistance in enterococcal isolates from nasal and perirectal area.

However, all analyses revealed a very high degree of variation around this mean, making the confirmation of links proposed by epidemiology, and inference of novel links, difficult. Despite this, in some cases, the phylogenetic context of other strains provided evidence supporting the confident exclusion of previously inferred epidemiological links.CONCLUSIONS: This in-depth analysis of the molecular clock revealed that it is slow and variable over short time scales, which limits its usefulness in transmission studies. However, the superior resolution of whole genome sequencing can provide the phylogenetic context to allow the confident exclusion of possible transmission events previously inferred via traditional DNA fingerprinting techniques and epidemiological cluster investigation.

It is less expensive than high-throughput methods, and it is appropriate for numerous applications including molecular diagnostics. However, sequencing mixtures of similar DNA of pathogens with this method is challenging. This is important because most clinical samples contain such mixtures, rather than pure single strains. The traditional solution is to sequence selected clones of PCR products, a complicated, time-consuming, and expensive procedure. Here, we propose the base-calling with vocabulary (BCV) method that computationally deciphers Sanger chromatograms obtained from mixed DNA samples. The inputs to the BCV algorithm are a chromatogram and a dictionary of sequences that are similar to those we expect to obtain. We apply the base-calling function on a test dataset of chromatograms without ambiguous positions, as well as one with 3-14% sequence degeneracy. Furthermore, we use BCV to assemble a consensus sequence for an HIV genome fragment in a sample containing a mixture of viral DNA variants and to determine the positions of the indels.

To determine the CagA phosphorylation motifs pattern (EPIYA pattern) in Cuban H. pylori isolates, and to study its association with patientå«s pathologies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNAs from 95 H. pylori cagA-positive strains were used to amplify the 3å« variable region of cagA gene by PCR using two different strategies. Additionally, new primers were designed to identify either Western or Eastern CagAEPIYA motiftype by PCR. To confirm the PCR results, PCR products from 14 representative isolates were purified and sequenced.RESULTS: The distribution of the EPIYA motif found was: 2 AB (2.1 %), 1 AC (1.1 %), 1 BC (1.1 %), 70 ABC (73.6 %), 19 ABCC (20 %), and 2 ABCCC (2.1 %).

The cell surface comprises a paracrystalline proteinaceous S-layer encoded by the slpA gene within the cell wall protein (cwp) gene cluster. Our purpose was to understand the diversity and evolution of slpA and nearby genes also encoding immunodominant cell surface antigens.METHODS: Whole-genome sequences were determined for 57 C. difficile isolates representative of the population structure and different clinical phenotypes. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on their genomic region (&gt;63 kb) spanning the cwp cluster.RESULTS: Genetic diversity across the cwp cluster peaked within slpA, cwp66 (adhesin), and secA2 (secretory translocase). These genes formed a 10-kb cassette, of which 12 divergent variants were found. Homologous recombination involving this cassette caused it to associate randomly with genotype. One cassette contained a novel insertion (length, approximately 24 kb) that resembled S-layer glycosylation gene clusters.CONCLUSIONS: Genetic exchange of S-layer cassettes parallels polysaccharide capsular switching in other species. Both cause major antigenic shifts, while the remainder of the genome is unchanged. C. difficile genotype is therefore not predictive of antigenic type.

CPS production is driven mostly by the expression of genes located in a locus called cps, and the resulting structure is used to distinguish between different serotypes (K types). In this study, we report the unique genetic organization of the cps cluster from K. pneumoniae Kp13, a clinical isolate recovered during a large outbreak of nosocomial infections that occurred in a Brazilian teaching hospital.RESULTS: A pyrosequencing-based approach showed that the cps region of Kp13 (cpsKp13) is 26.4 kbp in length and contains genes common, although not universal, to other strains, such as the rmlBADC operon that codes for L-rhamnose synthesis. cpsKp13 also presents some unique features, like the inversion of the wzy gene and a unique repertoire of glycosyltransferases. In silico comparison of cpsKp13 RFLP pattern with 102 previously published cps PCR-RFLP patterns showed that cpsKp13 is distinct from the C patterns of all other K serotypes. Furthermore, in vitro serotyping showed only a weak reaction with capsular types K9 and K34. We confirm that K9 cps shares common genes with cpsKp13 such as the rmlBADC operon, but lacks features like uge and Kp13-specific glycosyltransferases, while K34 capsules contain three of the five sugars that potentially form the Kp13 CPS.CONCLUSIONS: We report the first description of a cps cluster from a Brazilian clinical isolate of a KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. The gathered data including K-serotyping support that Kp13's K-antigen belongs to a novel capsular serotype. The CPS of Kp13 probably includes L-rhamnose and D-galacturonate in its structure, among other residues. Because genes involved in L-rhamnose biosynthesis are absent in humans, this pathway may represent potential targets for the development of antimicrobial agents. Studying the capsular serotypes of clinical isolates is of great importance for further development of vaccines and/or novel therapeutic agents. The distribution of K-types among multidrug-resistant isolates is unknown, but our findings may encourage scientists to perform K-antigen typing of KPC-producing strains worldwide.",PMC3438125,10.1186/1471-2180-12-173,cluster;drug resistance;genotype,,Klebsiella pneumonia,N,"mBio technique, little with genEpi"

The infection occurs in laying ducks characterized by a severe drop in egg production with a fatality rate of 5-15‰Û_%. The virus was found to be most closely related to Tembusu virus (TMUV), an isolate from mosquitoes in South-east Asia. Here, we have sequenced and characterized the full-length genomes of seven DEDSV strains, including the 5'- and 3'-non-coding regions (NCRs). We also report for the first time the ORF sequences of TMUV and Sitiawan virus (STWV), another closely related flavivirus isolated from diseased chickens. We analysed the phylogenetic and antigenic relationships of DEDSV in relation to the Asian viruses TMUV and STWV, and other representative flaviviruses. Our results confirm the close relationship between DEDSV and TMUV/STWV and we discuss their probable evolutionary origins. We have also characterized the cleavage sites, potential glycosylation sites and unique motifs/modules of these viruses. Additionally, conserved sequences in both 5'- and 3'-NCRs were identified and the predicted secondary structures of the terminal sequences were studied. Antigenic cross-reactivity comparisons of DEDSV with related pathogenic flaviviruses identified a surprisingly close relationship with dengue virus (DENV) and raised the question of whether or not DEDSV may have a potential infectious threat to man. Importantly, DEDSV can be efficiently recognized by a broadly cross-reactive flavivirus mAb, 2A10G6, derived against DENV. The significance of these studies is discussed in the context of the emergence, evolution, epidemiology, antigenicity and pathogenicity of the newly emergent DEDSV.",NA,NA,genome;surveillance;vector,,Dengue virus,N,"not dengue, closely related and dengue mentioned in abstract"

This meta-analysis assessed the effect of probiotic and synbiotic preparations on the incidence of postoperative sepsis.METHODS: Randomized controlled trials that compared preoperative dosing of probiotics and synbiotics in patients undergoing elective general surgical procedures were included. The primary outcome measure was the postoperative sepsis rate. Pooled outcome measures were determined using random effects models.RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials totaling 962 patients were included in this analysis (304 received synbiotics and 182 received probiotics). The incidence of postoperative sepsis was reduced in the probiotic group vs the control (pooled odds ratio [OR] = 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.75; P = .003) and in the synbiotic group vs the control (pooled OR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.1-0.6; P = .002). However, subgroup analysis failed to identify a significant reduction in the incidence of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or wound infections in the postoperative phase for either treatment group. Synbiotics reduced the length of postoperative antibiotic use (weighted mean differences = -1.71; 95% CI, -3.2 to -0.21; P = .03).CONCLUSION: Probiotic and synbiotic nutrition strategies reduce the incidence of postoperative sepsis in the elective general surgery setting.

The macroarray was then hybridized with labeled probes derived from each genomic island. In addition, PFGE patterns with SpeI, frequency of virulence genes, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of the strains were studied. Our results showed that almost all P. aeruginosa strains presented up to eight virulence genes. By SpeI macrorestriction fragment analysis we were able to identify 49 restriction patterns; 35 patterns correspond to single strains and the remaining 14 to strains subgroup (a-n).

Cholera remains endemic in developing countries and is still a significant public health issue. In this study we use multilocus variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) analysis (MLVA) to discriminate between isolates of the 7th pandemic clone of Vibrio cholerae.RESULTS: MLVA of six VNTRs selected from previously published data distinguished 66 V. cholerae isolates collected between 1961-1999 into 60 unique MLVA profiles. Only 4 MLVA profiles consisted of more than 2 isolates. The discriminatory power was 0.995. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, except for the closely related profiles, the relationships derived from MLVA profiles were in conflict with that inferred from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) typing. The six SNP groups share consensus VNTR patterns and two SNP groups contained isolates which differed by only one VNTR locus.CONCLUSIONS: MLVA is highly discriminatory in differentiating 7th pandemic V. cholerae isolates and MLVA data was most useful in resolving the genetic relationships among isolates within groups previously defined by SNPs. Thus MLVA is best used in conjunction with SNP typing in order to best determine the evolutionary relationships among the 7th pandemic V. cholerae isolates and for longer term epidemiological typing.",PMC3438101,10.1186/1471-2180-12-82,genome;phylogeny;genotype,,Vibrio cholerae,Y,"Note: pcr, not wgs"

Moreover, we detected that hospital MRSA clones, like EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16, had spread to the community and are now circulating in both environments. Therefore, in our study, the CDC's rules were not specific enough to distinguish CA-MRSA from HA-MRSA.

Few studies have reported clostridia colonization in PN whereas Bacteroides and bifidobacteria have been seldom isolated. Such aberrant gut microbiota has been suggested to be a risk factor for the development of intestinal infections. Besides, PN are often treated by broad spectrum antibiotics, but little is known about how antibiotics can influence clostridial colonization based on their susceptibility patterns. The aim of this study was to report the distribution of Clostridium species isolated in feces from PN and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Additionally, clostridial colonization perinatal determinants were analyzed.RESULTS: Of the 76 PN followed until hospital discharge in three French neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), 79% were colonized by clostridia. Clostridium sp. colonization, with a high diversity of species, increased throughout the hospitalization. Antibiotic courses had no effect on the clostridial colonization incidence although strains were found susceptible (except C. difficile) to anti-anaerobe molecules tested. However, levels of colonization were decreased by either antenatal or neonatal (during more than 10 days) antibiotic courses (p‰Û_=‰Û_0.006 and p‰Û_=‰Û_0.001, respectively). Besides, incidence of colonization was depending on the NICU (p‰Û_=‰Û_0.048).CONCLUSION: This study shows that clostridia are part of the PN gut microbiota. It provides for the first time information on the status of clostridia antimicrobial susceptibility in PN showing that strains were susceptible to most antibiotic molecules.

These findings posed the question of whether CHDL gene replacement occurred in the homogeneous ICL-II population or a new OXA-23 clone(s) emerged and spread in ICUs. In this study, the changes in the ICL-II A. baumannii population and CHDL gene carriage were investigated in 30 genetically related isolates collected during the bla(OXA-58)-to-bla(OXA-23) transition period. Pulsotyping, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) results were combined with multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA-8), siderotyping, and plasmid profiling to improve genotype-based discrimination between isolates. Pulsotyping, RAPD analysis, and MLST clustered isolates into a single type. MLVA-8 identified 19 types that clustered into three complexes. All OXA-23-producing isolates formed a single complex, while OXA-58 producers were split into two complexes. Southern blot analysis of the physical localization and genetic context of the CHDL genes showed that bla(OXA-58) was invariably located on plasmids, while bla(OXA-23) was present within Tn2006 on the chromosome or both the chromosome and plasmids. These data indicate that the apparently homogeneous population of CHDL-producing ICL-II strains was composed of several independent strains and that, between 2005 and 2009, distinct OXA-23 producers displaced the preexisting OXA-58 producers.

The causative agent, Neisseria meningitidis (Nm), can be phenotypically and genetically differentiated into serogroups and sequence types (STs) and has a highly dynamic population structure. To obtain a deeper understanding of the epidemiology of Nm, we sequenced seven Nm genomes. Large-scale genomic analysis was conducted with these 7 Nm genomes, 27 additional Nm genomes from GenBank, and 4 other Neisseria genomes. We observed extensive homologous recombination in all gene functional categories among different Nm genomes. Homologous recombination is so frequent that it has resulted in numerous chimeric open reading frames, including genes in the capsule biosynthesis cluster and loci targeted by commercial vaccines. Our results reveal that, despite widespread use, evolutionary relationships inferred from the standard seven-gene multilocus sequence typing (MLST) method could not predict virulence gene content or strain phenotype. In fact, up to 28% of the virulence-associated genes could differ between strains of identical STs. Consistent with previous studies, we found that allelic recombination is also associated with alterations in antibiotic susceptibility. Overall, these findings emphasize the extensive genomic plasticity of Nm and the limitations of standard molecular methods to quantify this genotypic and phenotypic diversity.",PMC3242501,10.1093/gbe/evr119,genotype;genome;drug resistance;phylogeny;mBio,,Neisseria meningitidis,Y,

A proper understanding of HIV-1 genomic diversity is a fundamental prerequisite for proper epidemiology, genetic diagnosis, and successful drugs and vaccines design. Here, we report on the partial and near full-length genomic (NFLG) variability of HIV-1 isolates from a well-characterized cohort of recently infected patients in SÌ£o Paul, Brazil.METHODOLOGY: HIV-1 proviral DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 113 participants. The NFLG and partial fragments were determined by overlapping nested PCR and direct sequencing. The data were phylogenetically analyzed.RESULTS: Of the 113 samples (90.3% male; median age 31 years; 79.6% homosexual men) studied, 77 (68.1%) NFLGs and 32 (29.3%) partial fragments were successfully subtyped. Of the successfully subtyped sequences, 88 (80.7%) were subtype B sequences, 12 (11%) BF1 recombinants, 3 (2.8%) subtype C sequences, 2 (1.8%) BC recombinants and subclade F1 each, 1 (0.9%) CRF02 AG, and 1 (0.9%) CRF31 BC. Primary drug resistance mutations were observed in 14/101 (13.9%) of samples, with 5.9% being resistant to protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and 4.9% resistant to non-NRTIs. Predictions of viral tropism were determined for 86 individuals. X4 or X4 dual or mixed-tropic viruses (X4/DM) were seen in 26 (30.2%) of subjects. The proportion of X4 viruses in homosexuals was detected in 19/69 (27.5%).CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the existence of various HIV-1 subtypes circulating in SÌ£o Paulo, and indicate that subtype B account for the majority of infections. Antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance is relatively common among recently infected patients. The proportion of X4 viruses in homosexuals was significantly higher than the proportion seen in other study populations.",PMC3193532,10.1371/journal.pone.0025869,surveillance;characterization;genome;drug resistance;mBio;vaccine,,Human Immunodeficy Virus,Y,

Pigs are susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses and have been proposed to be intermediate hosts for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses through reassortment or adaptation to the mammalian host. To further understand the genetic characteristics and evolution, we investigated the source and molecular characteristics of the H9N2 subtype swine influenza virus (SIV), and observed its pathogenicity in BALB/c mice. The BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 100 median mouse infectious dose of A/swine/HeBei/012/2008/(H9N2) viruses to observe the pathogenicity.

However, the use of short sequences significantly limits evaluation of genetic relatedness among HBV strains. Although analysis of HBV complete genomes using genetic cloning has been developed, its application is highly labor intensive and practiced only infrequently. We describe here a novel approach to whole genome (WG) HBV quasispecies analysis based on end-point, limiting-dilution real-time PCR (EPLD-PCR) for amplification of single HBV genome variants, and their subsequent sequencing. EPLD-PCR was used to analyze WG quasispecies from serum samples of patients (n‰Û_=‰Û_38) infected with HBV genotypes A, B, C, D, E and G. Phylogenetic analysis of the EPLD-isolated HBV-WG quasispecies showed the presence of mixed genotypes, recombinant variants and sub-populations of the virus. A critical observation was that HBV-WG consensus sequences obtained by direct sequencing of PCR fragments without EPLD are genetically close, but not always identical to the major HBV variants in the intra-host population, thus indicating that consensus sequences should be judiciously used in genetic analysis. Sequence-based studies of HBV WG quasispecies should afford a more accurate assessment of HBV evolution in various clinical and epidemiological settings.",PMC3176825,10.1371/journal.pone.0025232,characterization;genome;phylogeny;outbreak;genotype,characterization;genome;phylogeny;genotype,Hepatitis B,Y,

Clusters of strains with indistinguishable profiles were also assessed epidemiologically, and their MIRU-VNTR profiles compared with the UK M tuberculosis Strain Typing Database.RESULTS: 332 strains were typed (63 white patients, and 269 non-white patients). 198 MIRU-VNTR profiles were identified, with 144 profiles occurring only once. The typing clustered 187 strains into 53 clusters indistinguishable at all 12 loci and these were further characterised using the exact tandem repeat loci A, B, and C. The 15 loci clustered 32/63 (50.8%) of white and 110/269 (40.9%) of non-white cases and all but nine clusters were of the same ethnicity. The nine inter-racial clusters were further assessed from an epidemiological and clinical perspective and fingerprinting using nine additional loci. Isolates within two of the clusters were further discriminated using the additional nine loci. However, the additional loci did not further discriminate the isolates in the other seven inter-racial clusters.CONCLUSIONS: MIRU-VNTR fingerprinting indicates that although there is evidence of a high rate of transmission within the South Asian sub-population, the data suggest that there is little inter-ethnic transmission.",NA,NA,characterization;genotype;genome;drug resistance,,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,N,"no figures, but interesting table that could be visualized"

J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 75:973-977, 2006; Reidl J, Klose KE, FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 26:125-139, 2002). However, although this implies dispersal and growth across diverse environmental conditions, how locally successful populations assemble from a possibly global gene pool, relatively unhindered by geographic boundaries, remains poorly understood. Here, we show that environmental Vibrio cholerae possesses two, largely distinct gene pools: one is vertically inherited and globally well mixed, and the other is local and rapidly transferred across species boundaries to generate an endemic population structure. While phylogeographic analysis of isolates collected from Bangladesh and the U.S. east coast suggested strong panmixis for protein-coding genes, there was geographic structure in integrons, which are the only genomic islands present in all strains of V. cholerae (Chun J, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 106:15442-15447, 2009) and are capable of acquiring and expressing mobile gene cassettes. Geographic differentiation in integrons arises from high gene turnover, with acquisition from a locally co-occurring sister species being up to twice as likely as exchange with conspecific but geographically distant V. cholerae populations. IMPORTANCE Functional predictions of integron genes show the predominance of secondary metabolism and cell surface modification, which is consistent with a role in competition and predation defense. We suggest that the integron gene pool's distinctness and tempo of sharing are adaptive in allowing rapid conversion of genomes to reflect local ecological constraints. Because the integron is frequently the main element differentiating clinical strains (Chun J, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 106:15442-15447, 2009) and its recombinogenic activity is directly stimulated by environmental stresses (Guerin E, et al., Science 324:1034, 2009), these observations are relevant for local emergence and subsequent dispersal.",PMC3073641,10.1128/mBio.00335-10,drug resistance;genome;characterization,,Neisseria meningitidis,N,no wgs

We used high throughput sequencing of total DNA extracted from fecal material to characterize general community composition and examine the repertoire of microbial genes present in beef cattle feces, including genes associated with antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence. Results suggest that traditional 16S sequencing using &quot;universal&quot; primers to generate full-length sequence may under represent Acitinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Over eight percent (8.4%) of the sequences from our beef cattle fecal pool sample could be categorized as virulence genes, including a suite of genes associated with resistance to antibiotic and toxic compounds (RATC). This is a higher proportion of virulence genes found in Sargasso sea, chicken cecum, and cow rumen samples, but comparable to the proportion found in Antarctic marine derived lake, human fecal, and farm soil samples. The quantitative nature of metagenomic data, combined with the large number of RATC classes represented in samples from widely different habitats indicates that metagenomic data can be used to track relative amounts of antibiotic resistance genes in individual animals over time.

Sporadic acute human hepatitis E cases have been associated to genotype 3 and 4 strains of HEV also reported in swine populations of endemic and non-endemic areas. With the aim to evaluate the incidence of animals with current infection of HEV, 115 bile samples were collected from three slaughterhouses under inspection by Animal Sanitary Protection Agency of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In parallel, effluent samples were collected from six sewage pipe exit sites of two slaughterhouses. HEV RNA was detected in 11 out of 115 (9.6%) bile samples collected and three waste samples from one slaughterhouse. Viral loads observed for bile samples varied from 10(1)-10(5) genome copies/mL and for effluent samples mean load was 10(2) genome copies/mL.

Previous comparative whole-genome sequencing studies demonstrated that there has been recent clonal emergence of a subset of USA300 isolates, which comprise the epidemic clone. Although the core genomes of these isolates are closely related, the level of diversity among USA300 plasmids was not resolved. Inasmuch as these plasmids might contribute to significant gene diversity among otherwise closely related USA300 isolates, we performed de novo sequencing of endogenous plasmids from 10 previously characterized USA300 clinical isolates obtained from different geographic locations in the United States. All isolates tested contained small (2- to 3-kb) and/or large (27- to 30-kb) plasmids. The large plasmids encoded heavy metal and/or antimicrobial resistance elements, including those that confer resistance to cadmium, bacitracin, macrolides, penicillin, kanamycin, and streptothricin, although all isolates were sensitive to minocycline, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. One of the USA300 isolates contained an archaic plasmid that encoded staphylococcal enterotoxins R, J, and P. Notably, the large plasmids (27 to 28 kb) from 8 USA300 isolates--those that comprise the epidemic USA300 clone--were virtually identical (99% identity) and similar to a large plasmid from strain USA300_TCH1516 (a previously sequenced USA300 strain from Houston, TX). These plasmids are largely divergent from the 37-kb plasmid of FPR3757, the first sequenced USA300 strain.

In an attempt to establish a rapid procedure for laboratory diagnosis of TB and investigate the local TB epidemiology, molecular line probe assay of the Genotype MTBDRplus was used to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and detect mutations conferring resistance to two most active first-line drugs against TB: Rifampin and Isoniazid. 96 acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear- positive sputums and 18 PCR-positive non-sputum specimens have been determined for the MTBC and resistance to Rifampin and Isoniazid. The MTBC detection rates in two sources of specimens were 93.8% (90/96) and 77.8% (14/18) respectively. The overall drug resistance (Rifampin or Isoniazid) occurred in 34.6% (36/104). Resistance to rifampin (RMP) was 28.8% (30/104) and 25% (26/104) was to Isoniazid (INH), in which high level drug resistance accounted for 88.5% (23/26) and low level drug resistance accounted for 7.7% (2/26). Multidrug resistance (MDR), defined as resistant to both RMP and INH, was found in 19.2% (20/104) of clinical samples, which was double that of official statistics. In addition, 63.3% (19/30) RMP-resistant mutations were identified in the region of RopB 530-533 and 57.9% (11/19) were the S531L mutation. 84.6% (22/26) of resistance to INH was mediated by Kat S315T1 mutations which conferred the high-level resistance to INH.

Because of increased contact between bats, humans, and other animal species, the possibility exists for further cross-species transmissions and ensuing disease outbreaks. We describe here full and partial viral genomes identified using metagenomics in the guano of bats from California and Texas. A total of 34% and 58% of 390,000 sequence reads from bat guano in California and Texas, respectively, were related to eukaryotic viruses, and the largest proportion of those infect insects, reflecting the diet of these insectivorous bats, including members of the viral families Dicistroviridae, Iflaviridae, Tetraviridae, and Nodaviridae and the subfamily Densovirinae. The second largest proportion of virus-related sequences infects plants and fungi, likely reflecting the diet of ingested insects, including members of the viral families Luteoviridae, Secoviridae, Tymoviridae, and Partitiviridae and the genus Sobemovirus. Bat guano viruses related to those infecting mammals comprised the third largest group, including members of the viral families Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Poxviridae, Astroviridae, and Coronaviridae. No close relative of known human viral pathogens was identified in these bat populations. Phylogenetic analysis was used to clarify the relationship to known viral taxa of novel sequences detected in bat guano samples, showing that some guano viral sequences fall outside existing taxonomic groups. This initial characterization of the bat guano virome, the first metagenomic analysis of viruses in wild mammals using second-generation sequencing, therefore showed the presence of previously unidentified viral species, genera, and possibly families.

It mutates in an intensified manner and is considered a potential candidate for the possible next pandemic with all the catastrophic consequences.METHODS: Nasal swabs were collected from donkeys suffered from respiratory distress. The virus was isolated from the pooled nasal swabs in specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs (SPF-ECE). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing of both haemagglutingin and neuraminidase were performed. H5 seroconversion was screened using haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay on 105 donkey serum samples.RESULTS: We demonstrated that H5N1 jumped from poultry to another mammalian host; donkeys. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus clustered within the lineage of H5N1 from Egypt, closely related to 2009 isolates. It harboured few genetic changes compared to the closely related viruses from avian and humans. The neuraminidase lacks oseltamivir resistant mutations. Interestingly, HI screening for antibodies to H5 haemagglutinins in donkeys revealed high exposure rate.CONCLUSIONS: These findings extend the host range of the H5N1 influenza virus, possess implications for influenza virus epidemiology and highlight the need for the systematic surveillance of H5N1 in animals in the vicinity of backyard poultry units especially in endemic areas.",PMC2867947,10.1186/1423-0127-17-25,clinical;vector;phylogeny;drug resistance,,Haemophilus Influenza,N,"no humans, just donkjeys"

Based on the results of PFGE and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis, strains of the classical biotype remained diverse from those of El Tor biotype. The El Tor biotype strains formed multiple minor clusters and intermingled with each other irrespective of their origins and toxin types.

Enteritidis) has caused major epidemics of gastrointestinal infection in many different countries. In this study we investigate genome divergence and pathogenic potential in S. Enteritidis isolated before, during and after an epidemic in Uruguay.RESULTS: 266 S. Enteritidis isolates were genotyped using RAPD-PCR and a selection were subjected to PFGE analysis. From these, 29 isolates spanning different periods, genetic profiles and sources of isolation were assayed for their ability to infect human epithelial cells and subjected to comparative genomic hybridization using a Salmonella pan-array and the sequenced strain S. Enteritidis PT4 P125109 as reference. Six other isolates from distant countries were included as external comparators.Two hundred and thirty three chromosomal genes as well as the virulence plasmid were found as variable among S. Enteritidis isolates. Ten out of the 16 chromosomal regions that varied between different isolates correspond to phage-like regions. The 2 oldest pre-epidemic isolates lack phage SE20 and harbour other phage encoded genes that are absent in the sequenced strain. Besides variation in prophage, we found variation in genes involved in metabolism and bacterial fitness. Five epidemic strains lack the complete Salmonella virulence plasmid. Significantly, strains with indistinguishable genetic patterns still showed major differences in their ability to infect epithelial cells, indicating that the approach used was insufficient to detect the genetic basis of this differential behaviour.CONCLUSION: The recent epidemic of S. Enteritidis infection in Uruguay has been driven by the introduction of closely related strains of phage type 4 lineage. Our results confirm previous reports demonstrating a high degree of genetic homogeneity among S. Enteritidis isolates. However, 10 of the regions of variability described here are for the first time reported as being variable in S. Enteritidis. In particular, the oldest pre-epidemic isolates carry phage-associated genetic regions not previously reported in S. Enteritidis. Overall, our results support the view that phages play a crucial role in the generation of genetic diversity in S. Enteritidis and that phage SE20 may be a key marker for the emergence of particular isolates capable of causing epidemics.",PMC2784474,10.1186/1471-2180-9-237,outbreak;mBio;genome;diversity;clinical;diagnosis,,Salmonella Enterica,Y,

Over 40 genotypes of HPV infect the epithelial lining of the anogenital tract and other mucosal areas of the body. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection globally, with high prevalences found in both females and males. The predominant route of transmission is via sexual contact, although mother-to-child transmission is also possible. HPV infection may exist asymptomatically or may induce the formation of benign or malignant tumours in the genital, oral or conjunctival mucosa. Although most infections clear spontaneously, those that persist result in substantial morbidity and invoke high costs associated with the treatment of clinically relevant lesions. Some 13-18 mucosal HPV types are considered to have high oncogenic potential. HPV is recognized unequivocally as the main causal factor for cervical cancer, and is further responsible for a substantial proportion of many other anogenital neoplasms and head and neck cancers. Infections with HPV types that have low oncogenic risk, such as HPV-6 and 11, are associated with benign lesions of the anogenital areas known as condylomata acuminata (genital warts), oral papillomas, conjunctival papillomas, as well as low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions of the cervix. Perinatally acquired HPV can also cause recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in infants and young children.

This pathogen has been shown to follow the routes of human migration by their geographical origin and currently the global H. pylori population has been divided into six ancestral populations, three from Africa, two from Asia and one from Europe. Malaysia is made up of three major ethnic populations, Malay, Chinese and Indian, providing a good population for studying recent H. pylori migration and admixture.RESULTS: Seventy eight H. pylori isolates, including 27 Chinese, 35 Indian and 16 Malay isolates from Malaysia were analysed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of seven housekeeping genes and compared with the global MLST data. STRUCTURE analysis assigned the isolates to previously identified H. pylori ancestral populations, hpEastAsia, hpAsia2 and hpEurope, and revealed a new subpopulation, hspIndia, within hpAsia2. Statistical analysis allowed us to identify population segregation sites that divide the H. pylori populations and the subpopulations. The majority of Malay isolates were found to be grouped together with Indian isolates.CONCLUSION: The majority of the Malay and Indian H. pylori isolates share the same origin while the Malaysian Chinese H. pylori is distinctive. The Malay population, known to have a low infection rate of H. pylori, was likely to be initially H. pylori free and gained the pathogen only recently from cross infection from other populations.",PMC2708179,10.1186/1471-2180-9-126,genotype;geography,,Helicobacter pylori,Y,

Adamantane resistance is associated with a single amino acid change (S31N) in the M2 protein, which was shown to rapidly disseminate globally in 2005 in association with a genome reassortment event. However, the exact origin of influenza A/H3N2 viruses carrying the S31N mutation has not been characterized, particularly in South-East Asia. We therefore conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the HA, NA, and M1/2 segments of viral isolates collected between 1997 and 2007 from temperate localities in the Northern hemisphere (New York State, United States, 492 isolates) and Southern hemisphere (New Zealand and Australia, 629 isolates) and a subtropical locality in South-East Asia (Hong Kong, 281 isolates). We find that although the S31N mutation was independently introduced at least 11 times, the vast majority of resistant viruses now circulating globally descend from a single introduction that was first detected in the summer of 2003 in Hong Kong. These resistant viruses were continually detected in Hong Kong throughout 2003-2005, acquired a novel HA through reassortment during the first part of 2005, and thereafter spread globally. The emergence and persistence of adamantane resistant viruses in Hong Kong further supports a source-sink model of global influenza virus ecology, in which South-East Asia experiences continuous viral activity and repeatedly seeds epidemics in temperate areas.",PMC2705899,10.1016/j.virol.2009.03.026,clinical;treatment;phylogeny,,Haemophilus Influenza,Y,

Moreover, these SNPs were significantly associated with delayed progression to AIDS, AIDS-related death, and a CD4 T-cell count below 400 cells/mul. Both minor allele variants were independent predictors of disease progression, also when a CCR5 Delta32 heterozygous genotype was included in the analysis. However, predictive value was not independent from viral load and CD4 T-cell count at set point. The SNPs in the RNF39/ZNRD1 gene region were associated with set point CD4 T-cell count but not with disease course in the ACS.CONCLUSION: The minor allele variants of SNPs in the HLA-C and HCP5 gene regions are also in the ACS associated with a lower viral load at set point and additionally with delayed HIV-1 disease progression.

In contrast, the Stx2 high-producing strains carried the q933 gene allele, which was first reported on an stx(2) phage (933W), but not the q21 gene allele, and did not have mutations in the promoter region of the stx(2) gene. These 2 genetic characteristics, i.e., replacement of the q gene and mutation in the promoter region of the stx(2) gene, seemed to determine the amount of Stx2 produced by each strain.

However, the relationship between epidemiological dynamics and patterns of genetic diversity in AIV is not well understood, especially at the continental scale. To address this question, we undertook a phylogeographic analysis of complete genome sequences of AIV sampled from wild birds in North America. In particular, we asked whether host species, geographic location or sampling time played the major role in shaping patterns of viral genetic diversity. Strikingly, our analysis revealed no strong species effect, yet a significant viral clustering by time and place of sampling, as well as the circulation of multiple viral lineages in single locations. These results suggest that AIVs can readily infect many of the bird species that share breeding/feeding areas.",PMC2633721,10.1016/j.virol.2008.10.015,genome;diversity;transmission,,Haemophilus Influenza,M,"no humans, just birds, but they've got one really great visualization so I am using it"

The INNO-LiPA HPV genotyping kit was used to determine genotype. Human papillomavirus DNA was detected in 26 (21%) breast carcinomas. The most frequently detected HPV genotype was HPV-16 (92%), followed by HPV-6 (46%), HPV-18 (12%), and HPV-33 (4%). In 11 normal epithelium specimens adjacent to 11 HPV-16-positive carcinomas, 7 were HPV-16-positive.

There is a growing public health concern due to the emergence of a pandemic strain causing severe outbreaks worldwide. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the evolution and population structure of V. parahaemolyticus. In this work, we describe a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for V. parahaemolyticus based on the internal fragment sequences of seven housekeeping genes. This MLST scheme was applied to 100 V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated from geographically diverse clinical (n = 37) and environmental (n = 63) sources. The sequences obtained from this work were deposited and are available in a public database (http://pubmlst.org/vparahaemolyticus). Sixty-two unique sequence types were identified, and most (50) were represented by a single isolate, suggesting a high level of genetic diversity. Three major clonal complexes were identified by eBURST analysis. Separate clonal complexes were observed for V. parahaemolyticus isolates originating from the Pacific and Gulf coasts of the United States, while a third clonal complex consisted of strains belonging to the pandemic clonal complex with worldwide distribution. The data reported in this study indicate that V. parahaemolyticus is genetically diverse with a semiclonal population structure and an epidemic structure similar to that of Vibrio cholerae. Genetic diversity in V. parahaemolyticus appears to be driven primarily by frequent recombination rather than mutation, with recombination ratios estimated at 2.5:1 and 8.8:1 by allele and site, respectively. Application of this MLST scheme to more V. parahaemolyticus strains and by different laboratories will facilitate production of a global picture of the epidemiology and evolution of this pathogen.",PMC2293261,10.1128/JB.01808-07,outbreak;characterization;genotype;phylogeny;mBio;genome;diversity,,Vibrio cholerae;Vibrio parahaemolyticus,Y,

The genome, which for S. aureus is approx 2.8 Mb, is then digested with a rare cutting restriction endonuclease and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The restriction fragments generated are too large to be resolved by conventional electrophoresis. Therefore, resolution of the bands is achieved in a &quot;contour-clamped homogeneous electrical field&quot; where electrical current to the gel switches direction between multiple electrodes over a period of time.

The presence of HPV-DNA has been searched with nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by using consensus primer sets of MY09/11 and GP5/6 that target L1 region of the viral genome. HPV typing was performed by direct sequencing of the amplicons. In cytologic evaluation, 14 samples were diagnosed as ASC-US (Aypical squamous cells of undetermined significance), three were ASC-H (Atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude HSIL), five were HSIL (High-grade intraepithelial lesion), seven were LSIL (Low-grade intraepithelial lesion), four were LSIL+suspected HSIL, one was AG-US (Aypical glandular cells of undetermined significance) and one was atypical cells of undefined nature. HPV-DNA was detected in 28 of the 35 (80%) samples, and sequence analysis revealed high-risk HPV types (type 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 56, 59) in 22 (78.6%) samples, probable high-risk types (type 53) in two (7.1%) samples and low-risk types (type 6, 54, 72, 81) in four (14.3%) samples. HPV type 16 emerged as the most frequently-detected type, comprising 50% (14/18) of all samples; followed by type 18 in 10.7% (3/28) and type 53 in 7.1% (2/28) of the samples. As a result, although the number of cervical samples were relatively low, the preliminary data obtained with this study revealed the HPV type distribution, however more detailed studies are needed to elucidate the epidemiology of HPV infections in Turkey.",NA,NA,genome;characterization,,Human Papillomavirus,N,not accessible from UBC

The outbreak occurred in a large hospital in Poland and affected 27 patients, most of whom were colonised, in three wards, including the haematology unit. The E. raffinosus isolates had a high-level multiresistant phenotype and were initially misidentified as Enterococcus avium; their unambiguous identification was provided by multilocus sequence analysis. The molecular investigation demonstrated the clonal character of the E. raffinosus outbreak and the polyclonal structure of the E. faecium isolates. All of the isolates carried the same Tn1546-like element containing an IS1251-like insertion sequence, located on a c. 50-kb conjugative plasmid. One of the E. faecium clones, found previously to be endemic in the hospital, was probably the source of the plasmid.

We have found that genotype C is the most common in China, and this study aimed to determine the geographical distribution and characteristics of HBV-C subgenotypes in the country. A cohort of 534 patients with chronic HBV genotype C infection, collected across China, was analysed by nucleotide sequencing or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. HBV-C1/Cs (n = 112, 21%) and HBV-C2/Ce (n = 397, 74%) were the most common HBV-C subgenotypes and showed different geographical distribution in China. No significant differences were found between patients infected with HBV-C1 and HBV-C2 when comparing liver function tests, hepatitis B e antigen positive rate and clinical manifestations. We identified two other types of HBV-C provisionally designated as HBV-CD1 and HBV-CD2, which have particular virological features and clustered in one geographic area. These two types of C/D hybrids have emerged through recombination with genotype D and encode serotype ayw2 hepatitis B surface antigen. In conclusion, there are at least four subtypes of HBV genotype C: subgenotypes C1, C2 and two types of C/D recombinants CD1 and CD2 in China, which have a distinct geographic distribution.

In the past 2 yr, AI viruses have caused three epidemic waves. Disease prevention and control in all aspects have been actively carried out. Active and passive surveillance based on clinical observation and laboratory analysis were intensively conducted, as well as monitoring of genetic variation of the viruses. H5N1 viruses isolated from different avian species from different cases and locations were selected. We have sequenced specific genes (HA, NA, M, Ns, and part of PB2 genes) of 58 H5N1 isolates, as well as whole genome sequencing of 21 Thai influenza A (H5N1) viruses isolated during the 2004-2005 outbreak. Cluster analysis study showed that AI isolates were identified as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and belonged to genotype Z. The virus had a multiple basic amino acid motif at the cleavage site of HA, deletions in the NA stalk region, a five amino acid deletion in the NS1 gene, and genetic markers for amantadine resistance in the M2 gene. All 58 H5N1 isolates were closely related and grouped into the same cluster, together with isolates from wild birds, cats, tigers, and humans. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that Thai isolates were in the same cluster as Vietnamese isolates but aligned in a different cluster from Indonesian, Hong Kong, and Chinese viruses. In addition, genetic analysis showed that most avian influenza virus (AIV) isolates from Thailand had no major genetic changes in each gene such as HA (HA cleavage site, receptor binding site, N-link glycosylation site), NA (NA stalk region, oseltamivir resistance marker), M (the amantadine resistance marker, host specificity site), NS (five amino acid deletion site), and PB2 (host specificity site). All Thai poultry isolates contained the amantadine resistance marker while none of them had the oseltamivir resistance marker. To this end, the molecular characterization of H5N1 viruses from Thailand showed that there were no significant point mutations in the critical regions, and there was no evidence of changes in the viruses that indicate they are capable of sustained human-to-human transmission.",NA,NA,genome;vector;characterization;transmission;phylogeny;drug resistance,,Haemophilus Influenza,N,not accessible from UBC

Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the amplified sequences of the E1/E2 region of the HCV genome and were used to compare cases with unrelated sequences. A questionnaire-based, case-control study using matched controls recruited from each HIV unit identified putative transmission factors.RESULTS: One hundred and eleven HIV-positive men who have sex with men with acute HCV (genotype 1: 84%) were enrolled. Phylogenetic analysis of 93 E1/E2 sequences revealed seven monophyletic clusters signifying multiple independent HCV lineages co-circulating in the HIV-positive population. Permucosal rather than percutaneous transmission factors were associated with case/control status. Cases (n = 60) had more sexual partners, increased levels of high-risk sexual behaviour and were more likely to have shared drugs via a nasal or anal route in the preceding year in comparison with controls (n = 130). Sex in a group of more than two people was the strongest predictor of case/control status; odds ratios associated with participation in two or at least three types of high-risk sexual behaviour in a group were 9.16 (95% confidence interval, 3.51-23.90) and 23.50 (95% confidence interval, 9.47-58.33), respectively.CONCLUSION: The identified co-circulating HCV lineages belong to different subtypes and genotypes, implying that rather than viral change, the epidemic is due to permucosal transmission factors that should be the focus of public health interventions.",NA,NA,transmission;genotype;phylogeny;genome,,Hepatitis C;Human Immunodeficy Virus,Y,

We aimed to define possible viral factors implicated in the severe form of acute HBV infection.METHODS: We investigated viral factors in 42 patients with acute HBV infection: 11 had fulminant hepatitis (FH); 9 had a severe form of acute hepatitis (SAH), defined as having a prothrombin activity of less than 40% without encephalopathy; and 22 had acute self-limited hepatitis (AH).RESULTS: Although there was no significant difference in serum HBV DNA levels on admission among the three groups, the level decreased more rapidly in patients with SAH or FH than in those with AH. In patients with SAH or FH, the HBV load on admission was higher in patients who died than in those who recovered (7.0 +/- 1.6 vs 5.6 +/- 1.0 log copies/ml; P=0.0293). In univariate analysis, seronegativity for hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg) and mutations in both the precore (G1896A and/or G1899A) and core promoter (T1753A/C and/or T1754C/G and/or A1762T/G1764A) were associated with FH (odds ratio [OR], 5.60; P=0.0269 and OR, 52.0; P=0.0006; respectively).

Mutations in the precore region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome are frequently found in hepatitis B envelope antigen-negative cases. Data from India on the HBV genotype-associated distribution of precore mutations are limited. Our objective in this study was to genotype and detect the precore mutant with a point mutation from G to A at nucleotide 1896 using ligase chain reaction (LCR) and direct sequencing. A total of 115 cases of chronic liver disease were screened. The cases were evaluated on the basis of history, clinical examination, liver function profile, and serological test for HBV infection, which includes HBsAg, anti HBcIgG, HBeAg using commercially available ELISA kits. The cases, which were HBeAg+, HBeAg-, and HBV DNA+, were subjected to LCR and confirmed by direct sequencing. Of 115 chronic liver disease cases, 50 (43.5%) cases were HBV DNA positive. All cases were subjected to LCR; 11 (22%) cases confirmed the presence of precore mutants, while the remaining 39 (78%) were classified as the wild form of the virus. HBV genotyping by direct sequencing revealed that genotype D was predominant in both wild and mutant forms of the virus. We conclude that the HBV genotype distribution was not significantly different between precore mutants and the wild form of the virus (P&gt;0.05).

The sensitivity of clinically derived resistant HIV-1 strains to nucleotide RT inhibitors could be restored, however, in several laboratories by pharmacological depletion of the appropriate endogenous deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), and such a manipulation (induction of dCTP pool imbalance during reverse transcription in the presence of a non-nucleoside RT inhibitor) altered the mutation spectrum of the HIV-1 genome, resulting in a lower level of HIV resistance to certain drugs. The cytoplasmic single-stranded DNA cytidine deaminases APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F block HIV replication by introducing premature stop codons into the viral genome. We suggest that the resulting crippled, defective HIV (dHIV) variants could interfere with replication of &quot;wild type&quot; viruses and curbe disese progression in long term non-progressor individuals. Vif, an accessory protein encoded by HIV, counteracts APOBEC3G/F action. We speculate that small molecule inhibitors of Vif could permit lethal or sublethal mutagenesis of HIV genomes.

Host and viral characteristics associated with HBV mutations were determined.RESULTS: HBV viraemia was detected in 53 persons (65%) and was associated with lower CD4 cell count nadir and higher HIV RNA at the time of testing but not with 3TC duration. Known 3TC-resistant mutations occurred in 50% and 94% of viremic patients with &lt; 2 years and &gt; 4 years 3TC, respectively.

Of the four co-circulating viral serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4) that cause mild to severe febrile disease, DENV-2 has been implicated in the onset of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) in the Americas in the early 1980s. To identify patterns of genetic change since DENV-2's reintroduction into the region, molecular evolution in DENV-2 from Puerto Rico (PR) and surrounding countries was examined over a 20 year period of fluctuating disease incidence. Structural genes (over 20 % of the viral genome), which affect viral packaging, host-cell entry and immune response, were sequenced for 91 DENV-2 isolates derived from both low- and high-prevalence years. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that DENV-2 outbreaks in PR have been caused by viruses assigned to subtype IIIb, originally from Asia. Variation amongst DENV-2 viruses in PR has since largely arisen in situ, except for a lineage-replacement event in 1994 that appears to have non-PR New World origins. Although most structural genes have remained relatively conserved since the 1980s, strong evidence was found for positive selection acting on a number of amino acid sites in the envelope gene, which have also been important in defining phylogenetic structure. Some of these changes are exhibited by the multiple lineages present in 1994, during the largest Puerto Rican outbreak of dengue, suggesting that they may have altered disease dynamics, although their functional significance will require further investigation.",NA,NA,genome;phylogeny;vector,,Dengue virus,Y,

In India, the role of these two factors has been strongly implicated in cervical and other cancers, but the occurrence of HPV or p53 codon 72 polymorphism has not been examined in lung cancer, which is the most common cause of cancer-related death in India.DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A total of 40 tumor biopsy specimens from advanced lung cancer patients and blood samples from 40 matching control subjects were obtained for the analysis of high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 infection and p53 codon 72 polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: Only HPV type 18 was detected in 5% (2 of 40 lung cancer patients), but no other HPV could be detected. A significantly increased frequency of Arg/Arg homozygotes was observed in patients with advanced lung cancer when compared to that of control subjects (p = 0.004; odds ratio, 5.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.59 to 17.26). However, no significant correlation could be made between p53 polymorphism and different clinical stages, except for advanced stage IV patients, who showed a higher proportion of Arg/Pro heterozygous genotype.CONCLUSIONS: HPV detected in a small proportion of lung cancer patients in India demonstrated an exclusive prevalence of HPV type 18, and there was a significantly higher frequency of p53 Arg/Arg genotype when compared to that of control subjects. Observation of a shorter duration of symptoms (&lt; or = 4 months) in as many as 78% (seven of nine stage IV patients) with Arg/Pro genotype may be an indication that lung cancer patients with the heterozygous p53 genotype are more susceptible to early progression.",NA,NA,clinical;characterization,,Human Papillomavirus,N,no useful figures

Sixty-nine unique patient isolates of K. pneumoniae isolated from a variety of clinical specimens submitted to the clinical bacteriology laboratories of The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and associated General Practices were identified and susceptibility testing was performed with the Vitek system. Strains flagged as ESBL-positive by the Vitek system were subjected to isoelectric focusing. The results suggested that all 69 isolates harboured at least one ESBL, which was later confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with bla(TEM) and/or bla(SHV) primers. The purified PCR product was subjected to automated sequencing and the results were compared with the BLAST online search engine. Of the 69 isolates, 32 (46.4%) were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin, 11 (15.9%) were intermediate and 26 (37.7%) were sensitive. To investigate the epidemiological relationship between the ciprofloxacin-resistant ESBL-positive strains, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed. Rapidest software was used to calculate the genetic distance by the Nei distance method. PFGE analysis indicated that the clinical isolates belonged to four distinct genotype clusters (Groups A, B, C and D); each group or cluster was homogeneous or compact with respect to certain characteristics. Group A consisted of 25 isolates, group B of 3 isolates and Groups C and D of 2 isolates each. These results indicate that the spread of resistance is largely as a result of the dissemination of a single clonal strain. PCR was used to amplify the gyrA and parC genes from genomic DNA of the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. The amplified product was sent for analysis by automated DNA sequencing and the resulting DNA sequences were compared with the gyrA gene of K. pneumoniae. The sequencing results demonstrated that alteration of the GyrA subunit of DNA gyrase at amino acid 83 and/or amino acid 87 plays a central role in conferring high-level quinolone resistance in K. pneumoniae possessing ESBLs.",NA,NA,drug resistance;genome;clinical;diagnosis;mBio,,Klebsiella pneumonia,N,no useful figures

Sequence analysis of SARS-coronavirus isolates revealed that specific genotypes predominated at different periods of the epidemic. This information can be used as a footprint for tracing the epidemiology of infections and monitor viral evolution. However, direct sequencing analysis of a large number of clinical samples is cumbersome and time consuming. We present here a simple and rapid assay for the screening of SARS-coronavirus genotypes based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes for allelic discrimination.METHODS: Thirty SARS patients were recruited. Allelic discrimination assays were developed based on the use of fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes (TaqMan). Genotyping of the SARS-coronavirus isolates obtained from these patients were carried out by the allelic discrimination assays and confirmed by direct sequencing.RESULTS: Genotyping based on the allelic discrimination assays were fully concordant with direct sequencing. All of the 30 SARS-coronavirus genotypes studied were characteristic of genotypes previously documented to be associated with the latter part of the epidemic. Seven of the isolates contained a previously reported major deletion but in patients not epidemiologically related to the previously studied cohort.CONCLUSION: We have developed a simple and accurate method for the characterization and screening of SARS-coronavirus genotypes.

The polymerase protein sequences from the 1918 human influenza virus differ from avian consensus sequences at only a small number of amino acids, consistent with the hypothesis that they were derived from an avian source shortly before the pandemic. However, when compared to avian sequences, the nucleotide sequences of the 1918 polymerase genes have more synonymous differences than expected, suggesting evolutionary distance from known avian strains. Here we present sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome of the 1918 influenza virus, and propose that the 1918 virus was not a reassortant virus (like those of the 1957 and 1968 pandemics), but more likely an entirely avian-like virus that adapted to humans. These data support prior phylogenetic studies suggesting that the 1918 virus was derived from an avian source. A total of ten amino acid changes in the polymerase proteins consistently differentiate the 1918 and subsequent human influenza virus sequences from avian virus sequences. Notably, a number of the same changes have been found in recently circulating, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses that have caused illness and death in humans and are feared to be the precursors of a new influenza pandemic.

Public health interventions aimed at improving water, food and sanitation are unlikely adequately to control the disease. The development of vaccines against severe rotavirus diarrhoea is based upon homotypic or heterotypic protection provided against either a single common G serotype (monovalent vaccines) or against multiple serotypes (multivalent vaccines). Rotavirus strain surveillance has a high priority in disease control programmes worldwide. The continued identification of the most common G and P serotypes for inclusion in vaccines is an important priority. And subsequent to the introduction of a vaccine candidate, not only monitoring of circulating strains is recommended, but also surveillance of potential reassortment of animal rotavirus genes from the vaccine into human rotavirus strains is critical. Conventional methods used in the characterisation of rotavirus strains, such as enzyme immunoassay serotyping and reverse-transcription PCR-based genotyping often fail to identify uncommon and newly appearing strains. The application of newer molecular approaches, including sequencing and oligonucleotide microarray hybridisation, may be required to characterise such strains. The present paper presents a brief overview of the variety of standard methods available, followed by suggestions for a systematic approach for routine rotavirus strain surveillance as well as for characterisation of incompletely typed rotavirus strains.

The vps gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of the rugose EPS (rEPS) is positively regulated by VpsR. We recently identified media (APW#3) promoting EPS production and the rugose phenotype and found epidemic strains switch at a higher frequency than non-pathogenic strains, suggesting this switch and the rugose phenotype are important in cholera epidemiology. In this study, transposon mutagenesis on a smooth V. cholerae strain was used to identify mutants that were unable to shift to the rugose phenotype under inducing conditions to better understand the molecular basis of the switch. We identified vpsR, galE and vps previously associated with the rugose phenotype, and also identified genes not previously associated with the phenotype, including rfbD and rfbE having roles in LPS (lipopolysaccharide) synthesis and aroB and aroK with roles in aromatic amino acid synthesis. Additionally, a mutation in amiB encoding N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase caused defects in the switch, motility and cell morphology. We also found that a gene encoding a novel regulatory protein we termed RocS (regulation of cell signaling) containing a GGDEF and EAL domains and associated with c-di-GMP levels is important for the rugose phenotype, EPS, biofilm formation and motility. We propose that modulation of cyclic dinucleotide (e.g. c-di-GMP) levels might have application in regulating various phenotypes of prokaryotes.

Appropriate paradigms for immunogenetic studies of acute viral infections are dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Both primary and secondary infections with dengue virus (DEN) serotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4, can result in either clinically less severe DF or the more severe DHF. In secondary exposures, a memory response is induced in immunologically primed individuals, which can both clear the infecting dengue virus and contribute to its pathology. In a case-control study of 263 ethnic Thai patients infected with either DEN-1, -2, -3 or -4, we detected HLA class I associations with secondary infections, but not in immunologically naive patients with primary infections. HLA-A*0203 was associated with the less severe DF, regardless of the secondary infecting virus serotype. By contrast, HLA-A*0207 was associated with susceptibility to the more severe DHF in patients with secondary DEN-1 and DEN-2 infections only. Conversely, HLA-B*51 was associated with the development of DHF in patients with secondary infections, and HLA-B*52 was associated with DF in patients with secondary DEN-1 and DEN-2 infections. Moreover, HLA-B44, B62, B76 and B77 also appeared to be protective against developing clinical disease after secondary dengue virus infection. These results confirm that classical HLA class I alleles are associated with the clinical outcome of exposure to dengue virus, in previously exposed and immunologically primed individuals.",NA,NA,clinical;diagnosis;outcome,,Dengue virus,N,"most stats analysis, not figures"

This probe comprises a 12.5 kb genomic fragment of the Y. enterocolitica O:3 lipopolysaccharide O-antigen gene cluster cloned into plasmid pBR322. The genotyping potential of YeO:3RS was shown to reside in the region upstream of the O-antigen gene cluster, i.e., in the first 1.65 kb of the cloned genomic fragment that contains a repeated sequence (RS) present in multiple copies in the genome. In genotyping, the YeO:3RS probe was hybridised to DNA of Yersinia enterocolitica isolates (n = 112) from humans, animals and food, along with strains of other Yersinia species (n = 5) and Salmonella enterica strains (n = 3). The YeO:3RS probe efficiently detected and subtyped all European pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica isolates of the serobiotypes O:3/4, O:9/2 and O:5,27/2 studied (n = 87), whereas it hybridised only weakly or not at all with the other strains. Within Yersinia enterocolitica serobiotype O:3/4 strains, YeO:3RS genotyping was as discriminatory as genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of XbaI-NotI digested genomic DNA. When these two methods were combined, YeO:3RS genotyping divided both of the two predominant PFGE types into six subtypes, thus increasing the discrimination. In PCR screening of additional 86 Yersinia strains, the 1.65 kb region was detected in European pathogenic serotypes O:1 and O:2 in addition to serotypes O:3, O:5,27 and O:9, indicating that it can be exploited in detecting and typing of European pathogenic serotypes in general.",NA,NA,cluster;genome;characterization;genotype,,Salmonella Enterica,N,not accessible from UBC

The infection rate of the vaccinated populations in the Pacific Islands ranged between 0.7 and 3.8%, which is comparable to Taiwan. A vigorous polyclonal response This communication discusses the current status of research in the hepatitis B virus in relation to the South Pacific. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small DNA virus--3200 nucleotides. It has a circular genome and replicates through an RNA intermediate giving this DNA virus many characteristics similar to RNA viruses. Viral genomes can be single-stranded (+ or - sense) or double-stranded. If not vaccinated, infants born to HBeAg positive mothers (i.e. with high viral titer) have a 90% chance of being infected and becoming HBV carriers themselves. Mutants that affect the major antigenic determinant in HBV surface antigens are probably responsible for HBV infection despite immunization and mutants in the polymerase protein may render HBV resistant to therapy with nucleoside analogs. Within HBV seven genotypes A-G have been reported that is, HBV genotype A (HBVA), HBV genotype B (HBVB) etc. HBV is endemic worldwide with an estimated that 5% of the worlds population being carriers. Before the introduction of vaccination programs carrier rates varied between 5-30% in communities of these ethnic groups, and in some cases 80-90% of a community tested positive for HBV markers (i.e. were infected or had been infected). In Taiwan, of vaccinated babies born to HBV positive mothers, the proportion of those that responded to vaccination varied between will usually result in an acute infection and viral clearance. An associated problem with HBV, in the South Pacific, is the hepatitis delta virus (HDV). HDV is a satellite viroid-like RNA virus that requires HBV for replication. It can either co-infect with, or super-infect upon HBV infection resulting in acute infection and/or chronic infection respectively.",NA,NA,genotype;genome,,Hepatitis B,N,not accessible from UBC

We also studied 18 strains from 8 patients (parents and 6 daughters) from a Dutch family and paired strains collected on average 8 years apart from 11 patients.

However, the reported prevalences of HPV-DNA in HNSCC are variable. In the current study the authors used highly sensitive polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to analyze the occurrence of viral sequences in 98 carefully stratified HNSCCs. The authors determined the load and localization of HPV DNA in a subset of tonsillar carcinomas and their metastases.METHODS: Nested PCR and an HPV16 specific single step PCR were used to screen 98 HNSCCs for HPV DNA for genital- and Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV)-associated HPVs. Typing was performed by direct sequencing and/or sequencing of cloned amplimers. In two patients HPV16 subtypes in tonsillar carcinomas and their metastases were compared by amplification and sequencing of the long control region of the virus. In a subset of HPV16 positive tonsillar carcinomas and their metastases, localization and viral load were determined using laser assisted microdissection and real time fluorescent PCR, respectively.RESULTS: Altogether 25 HNSCCs (26%) were found to be HPV positive. Stratified according to the tumor localization, the frequency of HPV positive lesions was 18% in the oral cavity, 45% for oropharynx, 25% for hypopharynx, 8% for nasopharynx, and 7% for larynx. The highest HPV DNA prevalence (58%) was found in tonsillar carcinomas. The high risk HPV type 16 was found in 84% of positive HNSCCs, in 14% of which EV-associated HPVs were detected. Human papillomavirus sequences were detected in 64% of biopsies with normal mucosa from 11 patients with positive carcinomas. As a control group, 14 tumor free tonsils were analyzed. In none of these specimens were HPV sequences detected. Viral long transcriptional control region sequences in homologous metastases were identical with those in primary tumors and the load values in both locations were roughly comparable. Viral loads differed substantially in different areas of one tumor. Statistical evaluation of data related to clinicopathologic parameters showed a significant linkage of HPV with tonsillar carcinomas compared to other locations. Furthermore, a significant correlation of HPV status of tonsillar carcinomas with tumor grading and alcohol consumption was found.CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a preferential association of HPV-DNA with tonsillar carcinomas. The data support the view of HPV negative and positive tonsillar carcinomas being different tumor entities and conventional cancer risk factors being of less importance in HPV-infected individuals. The HPV genome is located in the cancer cells, whereas the infection of normal mucosa is a rare event.

Eleven of the 13 cases were related, forming two distinct groups. Further investigation revealed that one group contained five patients whose general health was good and who were not receiving HAART. In contrast, the second group of six patients, including the putative index case, were symptomatic, receiving HAART, and may have been infected with a CXCR-4-utilizing virus. Several of the cases that were linked by genetic criteria were not linked by contact tracing, implying that further undiagnosed cases may exist in this community.

We examined whether variation in interleukin 10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) genes would predict the likelihood of sustained response to antiviral therapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites at two loci encoding the cytokines IL-10 and TNF-alpha were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques. Their relationship to the outcome of antiviral therapy for chronic HCV infection was studied in 49 white patients who had a virologically sustained response (SR) and in 55 white nonresponders (NR) to a combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (IFN + R). Several IL-10 variants were more frequent among SRs compared with NRs. Carriage of the -592A or the -819T SNP was associated with SR (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2; P =.016). The -592A/A and the exclusively linked -819T/T genotypes were also associated with SR (OR = 16.6; P =.013 for either).

Strains originating from the North or the South differ strongly with respect to the number of copies of IS6110. Indeed, the strains originating from the north have predominantly from 3 to 14 IS6110 copies while the southern strains have predominantly from 15 to 23 IS6110 copies. Furthermore, strains isolated in the North are dispersed into 6 groups whereas 80% of the strains isolated in the South form a single group.

Only a few strains have been found with no IS6110 (1.8%). The differences between the strains from the North and South, having more than six IS6110, suggests that they derived from ancestral strains that would be distinguishable by the number of IS6110 and their transposition sites throughout the genome.

We have developed an LCR typing method to characterize point mutations in genes for SHV-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamases with four different sets of biotinylated LCR primers. To evaluate the applicability of the current technique, we tested seven Escherichia coli strains producing SHV-1, SHV-2, SHV-2a, SHV-3, SHV-4, SHV-5, and SHV-12. With the LCR typing, seven SHV genes can be distinguished according to their incorporating point mutations. In an attempt to characterize SHV beta-lactamases by LCR typing in clinical isolates, 46 strains carrying bla(SHV) genes (32 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 Enterobacter cloacae, and 4 E. coli) were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing, isoelectric focusing, and LCR typing. LCR typing allowed the characterization of beta-lactamases, and genotypes obtained by LCR typing were in accordance with phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance profile and pI value of beta-lactamase. Therefore, we concluded that LCR typing may permit defining the SHV families with simplicity and reliability and can be applied to the detailed characterization and molecular epidemiology of SHV-type beta-lactamases.",PMC89975,,drug resistance;mBio;characterization;genome,,Escherichia coli;Klebsiella pneumonia,N,methods

VRE outbreaks have to be controlled from the first cases which means that appropriate and sensitive genotyping methods are needed. The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of whole genome sequencing based analysis compared to Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) in epidemiological investigations as well as the development of a user friendly method for daily laboratory use. Out of 14,000 VRE - screening samples, a total of 60 isolates positive for either vanA or vanB gene were isolated of which 38 were from patients with epidemiological links from three suspected outbreaks at Uppsala University Hospital. The isolates were genotypically characterised with PFGE, MLST, and WGS based core genome Average Nucleotide Identity analysis (cgANI). PFGE was compared to WGS and MLST regarding reliability, resolution, and applicability capacity. The PFGE analysis of the 38 isolates confirmed the epidemiological investigation that three outbreaks had occurred but gave an unclear picture for the largest cluster. The WGS analysis could clearly distinguish six ANI clusters for those 38 isolates.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) determines the DNA sequence of a complete bacterial genome in a single sequence run, and from these data, information on resistance and virulence, as well as information for typing is obtained, useful for outbreak investigation. The obtained genome data can be further used for the development of an outbreak-specific screening test. In this review, a general introduction to NGS is presented, including the library preparation and the major characteristics of the most common NGS platforms, such as the MiSeq (Illumina) and the Ion PGM‰ã¢ (ThermoFisher). An overview of the software used for NGS data analyses used at the medical microbiology diagnostic laboratory in the University Medical Center Groningen in The Netherlands is given. Furthermore, applications of NGS in the clinical setting are described, such as outbreak management, molecular case finding, characterization and surveillance of pathogens, rapid identification of bacteria using the 16S-23S rRNA region, taxonomy, metagenomics approaches on clinical samples, and the determination of the transmission of zoonotic micro-organisms from animals to humans.

Newly synthesized viral RNA (vRNA) segments are exported from the nucleus and transported to the plasma membrane for packaging into progeny virions. Influenza viruses exploit many host proteins during these events, and this is the portion of the viral life cycle when genetic reassortment among influenza viruses occurs. Reassortment among influenza A viruses allows viruses to expand their host range, virulence, and pandemic potential. This review covers recent studies on the export of vRNAs from the nucleus and their transport through the cytoplasm, progressive assembly, and packaging into progeny virus particles. Understanding these events and the constraints on genetic reassortment has implications for assessment of the pandemic potential of newly emerged influenza viruses, for vaccine production, for determination of viral fitness, and for identification of novel therapeutic targets.",NA,NA,clinical;genome;outbreak,,Haemophilus Influenza,N,"Review, mainly illustrative figures"

Its infection can cause microcephaly, a serious birth defect during pregnancy. The recent outbreak of ZIKV in February 2016 in Brazil realized it as a major health risk, demands an enhanced surveillance and a need to develop novel drugs against ZIKV. Amodiaquine, prochlorperazine, quinacrine, and berberine are few promising drugs approved by Food and Drug Administration against dengue virus which also belong to Flaviviridae family. In this study, we performed molecular docking analysis of these drugs against nonstructural 3 (NS3) protein of ZIKV. The protease activity of NS3 is necessary for viral replication and its prohibition could be considered as a strategy for treatment of ZIKV infection. Amongst these four drugs, berberine has shown highest binding affinity of -5.8 kcal/mol and it is binding around the active site region of the receptor. Based on the properties of berberine, more similar compounds were retrieved from ZINC database and a structure-based virtual screening was carried out by AutoDock Vina in PyRx 0.8.

C. difficile is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in the developed world, and, in recent years, the emergence of hyper-virulent (mainly ribotypes 027 and 078, sometimes characterised by increased toxin production), epidemic strains and an increase in the number of community-acquired infections has caused further concern. Antibiotic therapy with metronidazole, vancomycin or fidaxomicin is the primary treatment for C. difficile infection (CDI). However, CDI is unique, in that, antibiotic use is also a major risk factor for acquiring CDI or recurrent CDI due to disruption of the normal gut microbiota.

This way, bacteria can acquire new traits such as antibiotic resistance or pathogenic toxins. Current bioinformatics approaches focus on the detection of past HGT events by exploring phylogenetic trees or genome composition inconsistencies. However, these techniques normally require the availability of finished and fully annotated genomes and of sufficiently large deviations that allow detection and are thus not widely applicable. Especially in outbreak scenarios with HGT-mediated emergence of new pathogens, like the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli outbreak in Germany 2011, there is need for fast and precise HGT detection. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies facilitate rapid analysis of unknown pathogens but, to the best of our knowledge, so far no approach detects HGTs directly from NGS reads.RESULTS: We present Daisy, a novel mapping-based tool for HGT detection. Daisy determines HGT boundaries with split-read mapping and evaluates candidate regions relying on read pair and coverage information. Daisy successfully detects HGT regions with base pair resolution in both simulated and real data, and outperforms alternative approaches using a genome assembly of the reads. We see our approach as a powerful complement for a comprehensive analysis of HGT in the context of NGS data.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Daisy is freely available from http://github.com/ktrappe/daisyCONTACT: renardb@rki.deSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",NA,NA,mBio;phylogeny;drug resistance,,Escherichia coli,N ,"method, figures are workflow"

Historically, several different molecular subtyping methods have been used for this purpose; however, emerging techniques, such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based techniques, that use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) offer a resolution that was previously not possible. With WGS, unlike traditional subtyping methods that lack complete information, data can be used to elucidate phylogenetic relationships and disease-causing lineages can be tracked and monitored over time. The subtyping resolution and evolutionary context provided by WGS data allow investigators to connect related illnesses that would be missed by traditional techniques. The added advantage of data generated by WGS is that these data can also be used for secondary analyses, such as virulence gene detection, antibiotic resistance gene profiling, synteny comparisons, mobile genetic element identification, and geographic attribution. In addition, several software packages are now available to generate in silico results for traditional molecular subtyping methods from the whole-genome sequence, allowing for efficient comparison with historical databases. Metagenomic approaches using next-generation sequencing have also been successful in the detection of nonculturable foodborne pathogens. This review addresses state-of-the-art techniques in microbial WGS and analysis and then discusses how this technology can be used to help support food safety investigations.

Assessment of E. faecium using MLST to understand the spread of this organism is an important component of hospital infection control measures. Recent studies, however, suggest that MLST might be inadequate for E. faecium surveillance.OBJECTIVES: To use WGS to characterize recently identified vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREfm) isolates non-typeable by MLST that appear to be causing a multi-jurisdictional outbreak in Australia.METHODS: Illumina NextSeq and Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing platforms were used to determine the genome sequences of 66 non-typeable E. faecium (NTEfm) isolates. Phylogenetic and bioinformatics analyses were subsequently performed using a number of in silico tools.RESULTS: Sixty-six E. faecium isolates were identified by WGS from multiple health jurisdictions in Australia that could not be typed by MLST due to a missing pstS allele. SMRT sequencing and complete genome assembly revealed a large chromosomal rearrangement in representative strain DMG1500801, which likely facilitated the deletion of the pstS region. Phylogenomic analysis of this population suggests that deletion of pstS within E. faecium has arisen independently on at least three occasions. Importantly, the majority of these isolates displayed a vancomycin-resistant genotype.CONCLUSIONS: We have identified NTEfm isolates that appear to be causing a multi-jurisdictional outbreak in Australia.

Limits of detection (LOD) with 95% probability values were estimated by testing 16 replicates of upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) RNA transcripts. Specificity was estimated by using 28 nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for other respiratory viruses. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using 18 lower respiratory specimens. The sensitivity test panel and the high inhibition panel were composed of nine specimens each, including eight and six specimens that were positive for MERS-CoV, respectively.RESULTS: The LODs for upE ranged from 21.88 to 263.03 copies/reaction, and those for ORF1a ranged from 6.92 to 128.82 copies/reaction.

Ebola virus can persist in survivors for months in immune-privileged sites; however, viral relapse causing life-threatening and potentially transmissible disease has not been described. We report a case of late relapse in a patient who had been treated for severe Ebola virus disease with high viral load (peak cycle threshold value 13.2).METHODS: A 39-year-old female nurse from Scotland, who had assisted the humanitarian effort in Sierra Leone, had received intensive supportive treatment and experimental antiviral therapies, and had been discharged with undetectable Ebola virus RNA in peripheral blood. The patient was readmitted to hospital 9 months after discharge with symptoms of acute meningitis, and was found to have Ebola virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). She was treated with supportive therapy and experimental antiviral drug GS-5734 (Gilead Sciences, San Francisco, Foster City, CA, USA). We monitored Ebola virus RNA in CSF and plasma, and sequenced the viral genome using an unbiased metagenomic approach.FINDINGS: On admission, reverse transcriptase PCR identified Ebola virus RNA at a higher level in CSF (cycle threshold value 23.7) than plasma (31.3); infectious virus was only recovered from CSF. The patient developed progressive meningoencephalitis with cranial neuropathies and radiculopathy. Clinical recovery was associated with addition of high-dose corticosteroids during GS-5734 treatment. CSF Ebola virus RNA slowly declined and was undetectable following 14 days of treatment with GS-5734. Sequencing of plasma and CSF viral genome revealed only two non-coding changes compared with the original infecting virus.INTERPRETATION: Our report shows that previously unanticipated, late, severe relapses of Ebola virus can occur, in this case in the CNS. This finding fundamentally redefines what is known about the natural history of Ebola virus infection. Vigilance should be maintained in the thousands of Ebola survivors for cases of relapsed infection.

Here, we describe the development of a novel, inexpensive, and user-friendly diagnostic assay based on a reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) method for the detection of all four serotypes of DENV in clinical samples. The diagnostic performance of the newly established pan-DENV RT-iiPCR assay targeting a conserved 3' untranslated region of the viral genome was evaluated. The limit of detection with a 95% confidence was estimated to be 10 copies of in vitro-transcribed (IVT) RNA. Sensitivity analysis using RNA prepared from 10-fold serial dilutions of tissue culture fluid containing DENVs suggested that the RT-iiPCR assay was comparable to the multiplex real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay for DENV-1, -3, and -4 detection but 10-fold less sensitive for DENV-2 detection. Subsequently, plasma collected from patients suspected of dengue virus infection (n = 220) and individuals not suspected of dengue virus infection (n = 45) were tested by the RT-iiPCR and compared to original test results using a DENV NS1 antigen rapid test and the qRT-PCR. The diagnostic agreement of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR, NS1 antigen rapid test, and qRT-PCR tests was 93.9%, 84.5%, and 97.4%, respectively, compared to the composite reference results.

The genetic determinant required for galactan-III synthesis was identified as a distinct operon adjacent to the rfb (wb) locus encoding D-galactan-I synthesis. The three genes within the operon encode predicted glycosyltransferases. Testing an isogenic transformant pair revealed that expression of D-galactan-III, in comparison to D-galactan-I, conferred improved survival in the presence of human serum. Eighty-three percent of the more than 200 ST258 draft genome sequences currently available carries the corresponding operon and hence these isolates are predicted to express galactan-III antigens. A D-galactan-III specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) was shown to bind to extracted LPS from a panel of ST258 isolates.

African bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the island's chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats.METHODS: Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different regions of Madagascar. We analyzed fecal and throat swabs to detect the presence of virus through amplification of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is highly conserved in all known coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed from positive specimens.RESULTS: From 351 frugivorous bats, we detected 14 coronaviruses from two endemic bats species, of which 13 viruses were identified from Pteropus rufus and one from Eidolon dupreanum, giving an overall prevalence of 4.5%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Malagasy strains belong to the genus Betacoronavirus but form three distinct clusters, which seem to represent previously undescribed genetic lineages.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CoVs circulate in frugivorous bats of Madagascar, demonstrating the needs to evaluate spillover risk to human populations especially for individuals that hunt and consume infected bats. Possible dispersal mechanisms as to how coronaviruses arrived on Madagascar are discussed.",PMC4404003,10.1186/s12985-015-0271-y,phylogeny;reservoir,,MERS coronavirus,Y,

Current methods require several days and/or provide low-resolution characterization. Here we describe a whole-genome-sequencing (WGS) approach (GeneSippr) enabling same-day identification of colony isolates recovered from investigative food samples. The identification of colonies of priority Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) (i.e., serogroups O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, O145 and O157) served as a proof of concept. Genomic DNA was isolated from single colonies and sequencing was conducted on the Illumina MiSeq instrument with raw data sampling from the instrument following 4.5 hrs of sequencing. Modeling experiments indicated that datasets comprised of 21-nt reads representing approximately 4-fold coverage of the genome were sufficient to avoid significant gaps in sequence data. A novel bioinformatic pipeline was used to identify the presence of specific marker genes based on mapping of the short reads to reference sequence libraries, along with the detection of dispersed conserved genomic markers as a quality control metric to assure the validity of the analysis. STEC virulence markers were correctly identified in all isolates tested, and single colonies were identified within 9 hrs. This method has the potential to produce high-resolution characterization of STEC isolates, and whole-genome sequence data generated following the GeneSippr analysis could be used for isolate identification in place of lengthy biochemical characterization and typing methodologies. Significant advantages of this procedure include ease of adaptation to the detection of any gene marker of interest, as well as to the identification of other foodborne pathogens for which genomic markers have been defined.",PMC4393293,10.1371/journal.pone.0122928,vector;outbreak;genome;mBio,,Escherichia coli,N,"method, figures are workflow"

The complete toxigenic mechanisms underlying virulence in Vibrio strains are poorly understood. The hypothesis of this work was that virulent versus non-virulent strains of V. cholerae harbor distinctive genomic elements that encode virulence. The purpose of this study was to elucidate genomic differences between the O1 serotypes and non-O1 V. cholerae PS15, a non-toxigenic strain, in order to identify novel genes potentially responsible for virulence. In this study, we compared the whole genome of the non-O1 PS15 strain to the whole genomes of toxigenic serotypes at the phylogenetic level, and found that the PS15 genome was distantly related to those of toxigenic V. cholerae. Thus we focused on a detailed gene comparison between PS15 and the distantly related O1 V. cholerae N16961. Based on sequence alignment we tentatively assigned chromosome numbers 1 and 2 to elements within the genome of non-O1 V. cholerae PS15. Further, we found that PS15 and O1 V. cholerae N16961 shared 98% identity and 766 genes, but of the genes present in N16961 that were missing in the non-O1 V. cholerae PS15 genome, 56 were predicted to encode not only for virulence-related genes (colonization, antimicrobial resistance, and regulation of persister cells) but also genes involved in the metabolic biosynthesis of lipids, nucleosides and sulfur compounds. Additionally, we found 113 genes unique to PS15 that were predicted to encode other properties related to virulence, disease, defense, membrane transport, and DNA metabolism. Here, we identified distinctive and novel genomic elements between O1 and non-O1 V. cholerae genomes as potential virulence factors and, thus, targets for future therapeutics.

Recent reports of the intercontinental spread of a CF-specific epidemic strain, combined with high intrinsic levels of antibiotic resistance, have made this opportunistic pathogen an important public health concern. Strain-specific differences correlate with variation in clinical outcomes of infected CF patients, increasing the urgency to understand the evolutionary origin of genetic factors conferring important phenotypes that enable infection, virulence, or resistance. Here, we describe the genome-wide patterns of homologous and nonhomologous recombination in P. aeruginosa, and the extent to which the genomes are affected by these diversity-generating processes. Based on whole-genome sequence data from 32 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, we examined the rate and distribution of recombination along the genome, and its effect on the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that recombination was common and usually involves short stretches of DNA (200-300 bp). Although mutation was the main source of nucleotide diversity, the import of polymorphisms by homologous recombination contributed nearly as much. We also identified the genomic regions with frequent recombination, and the specific sequences of recombinant origin within epidemic strains. The functional characteristics of the genes contained therein were examined for potential associations with a pathogenic lifestyle or adaptation to the CF lung environment. A common link between many of the high-recombination genes was their functional affiliation with the cell wall, suggesting that the products of recombination may be maintained by selection for variation in cell-surface molecules that allows for evasion of the host immune system.",PMC4316616,10.1093/gbe/evu260,clinical;genome;phylogeny;outbreak;outcome;drug resistance;vector,,Pseudomona aeruginosa,Y,

The worldwide diffusion of these strains is of great concern due to the high morbidity and mortality often associated with K. pneumoniae infections in nosocomial environments. We sequenced the genomes of 89 K. pneumoniae strains isolated in six Italian hospitals. Strains were selected based on antibiotypes, regardless of multilocus sequence type, to obtain a picture of the epidemiology of K. pneumoniae in Italy. Thirty-one strains were carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae carbapenemase producers, 29 were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, and 29 were susceptible to the aforementioned antibiotics. The genomes were compared to all of the sequences available in the databases, obtaining a data set of 319 genomes spanning the known diversity of K. pneumoniae worldwide.

Within this study, we used whole genome sequence (WGS) data to determine the evolutionary history and genetic diversity of CRISPR loci and cas genes among a diverse set of 427 Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica isolates representing 64 different serovars. We also evaluated the performance of CRISPR loci for typing when compared to whole genome and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approaches. We found that there was high diversity in array length within both CRISPR1 (median = 22; min = 3; max = 79) and CRISPR2 (median = 27; min = 2; max = 221). There was also much diversity within serovars (e.g., arrays differed by as many as 50 repeat-spacer units among Salmonella ser. Senftenberg isolates). Interestingly, we found that there are two general cas gene profiles that do not track phylogenetic relationships, which suggests that non-vertical transmission events have occurred frequently throughout the evolutionary history of the sampled isolates. There is also considerable variation among the ranges of pairwise distances estimated within each cas gene, which may be indicative of the strength of natural selection acting on those genes. We developed a novel clustering approach based on CRISPR spacer content, but found that typing based on CRISPRs was less accurate than the MLST-based alternative; typing based on WGS data was the most accurate.

We analyzed the genomes of 73 isolates from global sources, comparing five distinct outbreaks with sporadic infections as well as food contamination and the environment. Agona consists of three lineages with minimal mutational diversity: only 846 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have accumulated in the non-repetitive, core genome since Agona evolved in 1932 and subsequently underwent a major population expansion in the 1960s. Homologous recombination with other serovars of S. enterica imported 42 recombinational tracts (360 kb) in 5/143 nodes within the genealogy, which resulted in 3,164 additional SNPs. In contrast to this paucity of genetic diversity, Agona is highly diverse according to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), which is used to assign isolates to outbreaks. PFGE diversity reflects a highly dynamic accessory genome associated with the gain or loss (indels) of 51 bacteriophages, 10 plasmids, and 6 integrative conjugational elements (ICE/IMEs), but did not correlate uniquely with outbreaks. Unlike the core genome, indels occurred repeatedly in independent nodes (homoplasies), resulting in inaccurate PFGE genealogies. The accessory genome contained only few cargo genes relevant to infection, other than antibiotic resistance. Thus, most of the genetic diversity within this recently emerged pathogen reflects changes in the accessory genome, or is due to recombination, but these changes seemed to reflect neutral processes rather than Darwinian selection. Each outbreak was caused by an independent clade, without universal, outbreak-associated genomic features, and none of the variable genes in the pan-genome seemed to be associated with an ability to cause outbreaks.",PMC3630104,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003471,genome;diversity;surveillance;vector;drug resistance,,Salmonella Enterica,Y,

Diabetes is now considered as a worldwide epidemic by WHO, and is predicted to affect several hundred million people in the near future. Current therapies have failed to prevent or control hyperglycemia, as well as the deleterious cardiovascular consequences of the disease have increased. New paradigms are thus needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Over the last 15 years, we have been studying the intestine as a major regulator of the integrated cross-talk between the brain, liver, pancreas, muscles and blood vessels required for glycemic control. As a first example, we identified that during a meal the glucose transporter GLUT2 and the intestinal hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are involved in glucose detection by the entero-portal system. This was done using highly innovative experimental techniques in the awake free moving mouse. We then found that the enteric-vagal nervous system transmits this nutritional information towards the brain stem and hypothalamus, where leptin, neuropeptide Y and GLP-1 relay the enteric signal to control the endocrine pancreas (insulin-glucagon secretion), the liver (glycogen metabolism), the vascular system (vasodilation, arterial flow), and muscle metabolism. This &quot;anticipatory metabolic reflex &quot; is altered during diabetes and might thus represent a new pharmacological target. Subsequently, while investigating the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating this new physiological pathway, we discovered that a fat-rich diabetogenic diet alters the intestinal microbiota and permeability. This leads to an increase in the concentration of plasma lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which causes metabolic endotoxemia responsible for the induction of low-grade inflammation that characterizes type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, adipose tissue development and hepatic lipid storage. We then showed that bacteria can be translocated from the intestine towards tissues and the bloodstream. Bacterial DNA present in blood was found to be predictive of diabetes, 6-9 years before disease onset (patent), presenting new molecular targets in the microbiota-host relationship. This should enable the scientific community to discover new functional relationships between the genome and metagenome and thus to develop original preventive and therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases.

We aimed to unveil the genetic diversity and transmission characteristics of the Beijing strains in Peru. A total of 200 Beijing family strains were identified from 2140 M. tuberculosis isolates obtained in Lima, Peru, between December 2008 and January 2010. Of them, 198 strains were classified into sublineages, on the basis of 10 sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). They were also subjected to variable number tandem-repeat (VNTR) typing using an international standard set of 15 loci (15-MIRU-VNTR) plus 9 additional loci optimized for Beijing strains. An additional 70 Beijing family strains, isolated between 1999 and 2006 in Lima, were also analyzed in order to make a longitudinal comparison. The Beijing family was the third largest spoligotyping clade in Peru. Its population structure, by SNP typing, was characterized by a high frequency of Sequence Type 10 (ST10), which belongs to a modern subfamily of Beijing strains (178/198, 89.9%). Twelve strains belonged to the ancient subfamily (ST3 [n=3], ST25 [n=1], ST19 [n=8]). Overall, the polymorphic information content for each of the 24 loci values was low. The 24 loci VNTR showed a high clustering rate (80.3%) and a high recent transmission index (RTI(n-1)=0.707). These strongly suggest the active and on-going transmission of Beijing family strains in the survey area. Notably, 1 VNTR genotype was found to account for 43.9% of the strains. Comparisons with data from East Asia suggested the genotype emerged as a uniquely endemic clone in Peru.

Antiviral drugs such as neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors will be crucial for disease control in the event of a pandemic. Should drug-resistant H5N1 viruses develop, all defense strategies will be compromised.

To monitor the emergence of changes associated with the adaptation of H5N1 viruses to humans, we passaged the strains in the absence of drugs. Under pressure of each NA inhibitor, A/Turkey/65-1242/06 developed mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) (H28R and P194L/T215I) and NA (E119A) proteins that reduced virus binding to ë±2,3-sialyl receptor and NA activity.

Both strains were eliminated in NHBE cells when they were cultivated in the absence of drugs.

ClonalFrame linked several groups previously identified by eBURST and MST, and provided insight to the evolutionary events occurring in the population; the recombination/mutation ratio was found to be 8.4. A Neighbor-Net analysis based on the concatenated sequences revealed a complex network, providing evidence of frequent recombination. The index of association when all the strains were considered indicated a freely recombining population.

Although the natural occurrence of both diseases' is now relatively rare, the possibility of terrorist groups using these pathogens as a bioweapon is real. Because of the disease's inherent communicability, rapid clinical course, and high mortality rate, it is critical that an outbreak be detected quickly. Therefore methodologies that provide rapid detection and diagnosis are essential to ensure immediate implementation of public health measures and activation of crisis management. Recombinant reporter phage may provide a rapid and specific approach for the detection of Y. pestis and B. anthracis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently use the classical phage lysis assays for the confirmed identification of these bacterial pathogens. These assays take advantage of naturally occurring phage which are specific and lytic for their bacterial hosts. After overnight growth of the cultivated bacterium in the presence of the specific phage, the formation of plaques (bacterial lysis) provides a positive identification of the bacterial target. Although these assays are robust, they suffer from three shortcomings: 1) they are laboratory based; 2) they require bacterial isolation and cultivation from the suspected sample, and 3) they take 24-36 h to complete. To address these issues, recombinant &quot;light-tagged&quot; reporter phage were genetically engineered by integrating the Vibrio harveyi luxAB genes into the genome of Y. pestis and B. anthracis specific phage. The resulting luxAB reporter phage were able to detect their specific target by rapidly (within minutes) and sensitively conferring a bioluminescent phenotype to recipient cells. Importantly, detection was obtained either with cultivated recipient cells or with mock-infected clinical specimens. For demonstration purposes, here we describe the method for the phage-mediated detection of a known Y. pestis isolate using a luxAB reporter phage constructed from the CDC plague diagnostic phage ë_A1122 (Figure 1). A similar method, with minor modifications (e.g. change in growth temperature and media), may be used for the detection of B. anthracis isolates using the B. anthracis reporter phage Wë_::luxAB. The method describes the phage-mediated transduction of a biolumescent phenotype to cultivated Y. pestis cells which are subsequently measured using a microplate luminometer. The major advantages of this method over the traditional phage lysis assays is the ease of use, the rapid results, and the ability to test multiple samples simultaneously in a 96-well microtiter plate format.

Since the dengue epidemic outbreak declared in Argentina in 2009, numerous patients' samples were analyzed for the acute phase of infection. One of the main methodological drawbacks is the lack of internal control to measure the effectiveness of the viral extraction and reverse transcription process. In this article, we propose to standardize a molecular method to detect beta actin (ë_-Act) and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) complementary DNAs (cDNAs) present in patient's plasma/serum, as a control process.RESULTS: RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and PCRs for human G6PDH, ë_-Act, and the dengue virus genome were performed. cDNA fragments for ë_-Act and G6PDH were amplified for all samples, regardless of the presence or absence of viral RNA.CONCLUSIONS: Amplification of ë_-Act and G6PDH cDNAs can be used as a control for the extraction and reverse transcription processes during dengue virus detection.

Beginning in 1996, a more virulent strain having serotype O3:K6 caused major outbreaks in India and other parts of the world, resulting in the emergence of a pandemic. Other serovariants of this strain emerged during its dissemination and together with the original O3:K6 were termed strains of the pandemic clone. Two genomes, one of this virulent strain and one pre-pandemic strain have been sequenced. We sequenced four additional genomes of V. parahaemolyticus in this study that were isolated from different geographical regions and time points. Comparative genomic analyses of six strains of V. parahaemolyticus isolated from Asia and Peru were performed in order to advance knowledge concerning the evolution of V. parahaemolyticus; specifically, the genetic changes contributing to serotype conversion and virulence. Two pre-pandemic strains and three pandemic strains, isolated from different geographical regions, were serotype O3:K6 and either toxin profiles (tdh+, trh-) or (tdh-, trh+). The sixth pandemic strain sequenced in this study was serotype O4:K68.RESULTS: Genomic analyses revealed that the trh+ and tdh+ strains had different types of pathogenicity islands and mobile elements as well as major structural differences between the tdh pathogenicity islands of the pre-pandemic and pandemic strains. In addition, the results of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis showed that 94% of the SNPs between O3:K6 and O4:K68 pandemic isolates were within a 141 kb region surrounding the O- and K-antigen-encoding gene clusters. The &quot;core&quot; genes of V. parahaemolyticus were also compared to those of V. cholerae and V. vulnificus, in order to delineate differences between these three pathogenic species. Approximately one-half (49-59%) of each species' core genes were conserved in all three species, and 14-24% of the core genes were species-specific and in different functional categories.CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the idea that the pandemic strains are closely related and that recent South American outbreaks of foodborne disease caused by V. parahaemolyticus are closely linked to outbreaks in India. Serotype conversion from O3:K6 to O4:K68 was likely due to a recombination event involving a region much larger than the O-antigen- and K-antigen-encoding gene clusters. Major differences between pathogenicity islands and mobile elements are also likely driving the evolution of V. parahaemolyticus.

In this regard, the literature provides a novel concept that we call &quot;MicrObesity&quot; (Microbes and Obesity), which is devoted to deciphering the specific role of dysbiosis and its impact on host metabolism and energy storage. In the present review, we discuss novel findings that may partly explain how the microbial community participates in the development of the fat mass development, insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation that characterise obesity. In recent years, numerous mechanisms have been proposed and several proteins identified. Amongst the key players involved in the control of fat mass development, Fasting induced adipose factor, AMP-activated protein kinase, G-protein coupled receptor 41 and G-protein coupled receptor 43 have been linked to gut microbiota. In addition, the discovery that low-grade inflammation might be directly linked to the gut microbiota through metabolic endotoxaemia (elevated plasma lipopolysaccharide levels) has led to the identification of novel mechanisms involved in the control of the gut barrier. Amongst these, the impacts of glucagon-like peptide-2, the endocannabinoid system and specific bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium spp.) have been investigated. Moreover, the advent of probiotic and prebiotic treatments appears to be a promising &quot;pharmaco-nutritional&quot; approach to reversing the host metabolic alterations linked to the dysbiosis observed in obesity.

To search for AbaR-type genomic antibiotic resistance islands and determine the genetic organization of any AbaR detected.METHODS: Two groups of multiply antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii strains isolated between 2002 and 2007 at three Sydney hospitals were studied. Various molecular techniques were used to determine whether they belong to European epidemic clones and to detect and characterize the AbaR.RESULTS: One group of five isolates belonged to European clone I. In these, an AbaR-type island, characterized by the presence of resistance genes and Tn6018, was present. Mapping revealed two novel AbaR configurations, AbaR6 and AbaR7, with IS26-generated deletions of 29 and 36.2 kb, respectively, relative to AbaR5. The second group contained seven isolates belonging to European clone II and, in these, a different transposon was present in the same chromosomal location as the AbaR genomic resistance islands.CONCLUSIONS: Multiply antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii strains belonging to both European epidemic clonal lineages I and II are found in Australian hospitals, indicating that these clones are globally distributed.

Influenza pandemic strains are the results of emerging viruses from non-human reservoirs to which humans have little or no immunity. At least two of these pandemic strains, in 1957 and in 1968, were the results of reassortments between human and avian viruses. Also, many cases of swine influenza viruses have reportedly infected humans, in particular, the recent H1N1 influenza virus of swine origin, isolated in Mexico and the United States. Pigs are documented to allow productive replication of human, avian, and swine influenza viruses. Thus it has been conjectured that pigs are the &quot;mixing vessel&quot; that create the avian-human reassortant strains, causing the human pandemics. Hence, studying the process and patterns of viral reassortment, especially in pigs, is a key to better understanding of human influenza pandemics. In the last few years, databases containing sequences of influenza A viruses, including swine viruses, collected since 1918 from diverse geographical locations, have been developed and made publicly available. In this paper, we study an ensemble of swine influenza viruses to analyze the reassortment phenomena through several statistical techniques. The reassortment patterns in swine viruses prove to be similar to the previous results found in human viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, that the surface glycoprotein coding segments reassort most often. Moreover, we find that one of the polymerase segments (PB1), reassorted in the strains responsible for the last two human pandemics, also reassorts frequently.",PMC2752997,10.1371/journal.pone.0007366,outbreak;characterization;vector;geography,,Haemophilus Influenza,M,"no humans, just pigs, but interesting figures so I'm including it"

In 1996, a pandemic O3:K6 strain abruptly appeared and caused the first pandemic of this pathogen to spread throughout many Asian countries, America, Europe, and Africa. The role of temperate bacteriophages in the evolution of this pathogen is of great interest. In this work, a new temperate phage, VP882, from a pandemic O3:K6 strain of V. parahaemolyticus was purified and characterized after mitomycin C induction. VP882 was a Myoviridae bacteriophage with a polyhedral head and a long rigid tail with a sheath-like structure. It infected and lysed high proportions of V. parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, and Vibrio cholerae strains. The genome of phage VP882 was sequenced and was 38,197 bp long, and 71 putative open reading frames were identified, of which 27 were putative functional phage or bacterial genes. VP882 had a linear plasmid-like genome with a putative protelomerase gene and cohesive ends. The genome does not integrate into the host chromosome but was maintained as a plasmid in the lysogen. Analysis of the reaction sites of the protelomerases in different plasmid-like phages revealed that VP882 and PhiHAP-1 were highly similar, while N15, PhiKO2, and PY54 made up another closely related group. The presence of DNA adenine methylase and quorum-sensing transcriptional regulators in VP882 may play a specific role in this phage or regulate physiological or virulence-associated traits of the hosts.

Mutational escape within targeted CD8 epitopes during acute HCV infection has been well documented and is one possible mechanism for T-cell failure. HLA-B*08 was recently identified as one HLA class I allele associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV replication. Selection of escape mutations in the immunodominant HLA-B*08-restricted epitope HSKKKCDEL(1395-1403) was observed during acute infection. However, little is known about the impact of escape mutations in this epitope on viral replication capacity. Their previously reported reversion back toward the consensus residue in patients who do not possess the B*08 allele suggests that the consensus sequence in this epitope is advantageous for viral replication in the absence of immune pressure. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of mutational escape from this immunodominant epitope on viral replication. We analyzed it with a patient cohort with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection and in a single-source outbreak (genotype 1b). Sequence changes in this highly conserved region are rare and selected almost exclusively in the presence of the HLA-B*08 allele. When tested in the subgenomic replicon (Con1), the observed mutations reduce viral replication compared with the prototype sequence. The results provide direct evidence that escape mutations in this epitope are associated with fitness costs and that the antiviral effect of HLA-B*08-restricted T cells is sufficiently strong to force the virus to adopt a relatively unfavorable sequence.",PMC2583685,10.1128/JVI.00997-08,genome;diversity,,Hepatitis C,M,"intra-host variation, odd figures, "

Typhimurium) DT104. SGI1 contains a complex integron, which confers various multidrug resistance phenotypes due to its genetic plasticity. Previous studies have shown that SGI1 integrates site-specifically into the S. enterica, Escherichia coli, or Proteus mirabilis chromosome at the 3' end of thdF gene (attB site).PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the transfer of SGI1 to a Delta thdF mutant of S. Typhimurium LT2. In the absence of thdF, the frequency of transconjugant formation was reduced by around thirty times of magnitude. Through DNA sequencing SGI1 was shown to integrate specifically into a secondary attachment site (2(nd)attB), which is located in the intergenic region between the chromosomal sodB and purR genes. At this 2(nd)attB site, we found that a significant fraction of SGI1 transconjugants (43% of wild type and 100% of Delta thdF mutant) contained tandem SGI1 arrays. Moreover, in wild type S. Typhimurium LT2 transconjugants, SGI1 integrated into both attachment sites, i.e., thdF and sodB-purR. The formation of SGI1 tandem arrays occurred in both specific attB sites. There was heterogeneity in the size of the SGI1 tandem arrays detected in single transconjugant colonies. Some arrays consisted as far as six SGI1s arranged in tandem. These tandem arrays were shown to persist during serial passages with or without antibiotic selection pressure.SIGNIFICANCE: The ability of integration into two distinct chromosomal sites and tandem array formation of SGI1 could contribute to its spread and persistence. The existence of a secondary attachment site in the Salmonella chromosome has potential implications for the mobility of SGI1, which may integrate in other attachment sites of other bacterial pathogens that do not possess the 1(st) or 2(nd) specific SGI1 attB sites of Salmonella.",PMC2297512,10.1371/journal.pone.0002060,genome;drug resistance;clinical;diagnosis,,Escherichia coli;Salmonella Enterica,N,"mbio, mostly lab picture"

The inserted DNA sequence possessed the genetic structures shared by insertion sequences (ISs) of the IS3 family. This IS had 26-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats (IRs) and two partially overlapping reading frames, orfA and orfB. OrfA codes for a helix-turn-helix, OrfA and OrfAB produced by translational frameshifting code for leucine zipper motifs, and OrfB codes for a DDE motif. orfA and orfB were homologous to those in the IS3 family.

Genome-wide regulatory processes of gene expression could explain parts of this bacterial duality. Transcriptional sigma70 factors are components of these processes. They allow the reversible binding of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase to form the holoenzyme that will lead to mRNA synthesis from a DNA promoter region. Bcc genome-wide analyses were performed to investigate the major evolutionary trends taking place in the sigma70 family of these bacteria.RESULTS: Twenty sigma70 paralogous genes were detected in the Burkholderia cenocepacia strain J2315 (Bcen-J2315) genome, of which 14 were of the ECF (extracytoplasmic function) group. Non-ECF paralogs were related to primary (rpoD), alternative primary, stationary phase (rpoS), flagellin biosynthesis (fliA), and heat shock (rpoH) factors. The number of sigma70 genetic determinants among this genome was of 2,86 per Mb. This number is lower than the one of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a species found in similar habitats including CF lungs. These two bacterial groups showed strikingly different sigma70 family architectures, with only three ECF paralogs in common (fecI-like, pvdS and algU). Bcen-J2315 sigma70 paralogs showed clade-specific distributions. Some paralogs appeared limited to the ET12 epidemic clone (ecfA2), particular Bcc species (sigI), the Burkholderia genus (ecfJ, ecfF, and sigJ), certain proteobacterial groups (ecfA1, ecfC, ecfD, ecfE, ecfG, ecfL, ecfM and rpoS), or were broadly distributed in the eubacteria (ecfI, ecfK, ecfH, ecfB, and rpoD-, rpoH-, fliA-like genes). Genomic instability of this gene family was driven by chromosomal inversion (ecfA2), recent duplication events (ecfA and RpoD), localized (ecfG) and large scale deletions (sigI, sigJ, ecfC, ecfH, and ecfK), and a phage integration event (ecfE).CONCLUSION: The Bcc sigma70 gene family was found to be under strong selective pressures that could lead to acquisition/deletion, and duplication events modifying its architecture.

Our major goal was to study the distribution of HIV-1 variants over a 5-year period against a background of political instability and civil war. A total of 288 HIV-1-positive samples collected in 2002 from sentinel population groups in an HIV serosurveillance study performed in 4 cities (Kinshasa [capital city], Mbuji-Mayi [south], Lubumbashi [southeast], and Kisangani [northeast]) were genetically characterized by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the V3-V5 env region. The results were compared with those obtained in 1997. Similarly, as in 1997, an extremely high genetic diversity of HIV-1 strains overall and a heterogeneous geographic distribution were seen in 2002. All subtypes and several circulating recombinant forms were present, high intrasubtype diversity was observed, and 5.6% of the samples could not be classified. In each geographic region of the DRC, the genetic diversity was significantly higher than in neighboring countries. Comparison of subtype distribution in similar population groups in Kinshasa in 1997 and 2002 revealed an overall increase of subtype C in Kinshasa from 2.1% to 9.7% and, more precisely, from 0% to 18.9% in female sex workers (P = 0.013). Genetic characterization of HIV-positive samples from sentinel surveys adds significant additional information on new trends in the HIV epidemic. These changes could have implications regarding the spread of HIV infection in the DRC as well on vaccine and/or treatment strategies.",NA,NA,clinical;diagnosis;geography;genome;diversity;outbreak;international;phylogeny;surveillance,,Human Immunodeficy Virus,N,not accessible from UBC
First,27407775,2005,"Medical journal, Armed Forces India","Gupta, R M;Sahni, A K;Jena, J;Nema, S K",Genomic Diversity of Human Immunodeficiency Viruses.,"BACKGROUND: Globally circulating strains of human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) exhibit an extraordinary degree of genetic diversity. Sequences derived from HIV-1 strains have historically been classified on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships. The viruses have been classified into groups, subtypes or clades and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). Groups were originally named M for main, O for outlier and N for Non-M-Non-O. The identification of subtypes and CRFs provides a means of tracking the dissemination of the pandemic.METHODS: Various methods to study the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 are virus isolation, cloning, DNA sequencing, restricted fragment length polymorphism of the molecularly cloned and amplified genome (PCR-RFLP), RNase mismatch cleavage analyses of RNA, RNA heteroduplexes derived from culture amplified virus, primer mismatch sensitive PCR to identify specific mutations, single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) to localize mutations arising over short regions of env gene, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and serological assays based on V3 peptide. Except for PCR-RFLP and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, these techniques do not easily allow simultaneous analyses of multiple sequence variants and include the laborious and selective process of virus co-cultivation or molecular cloning prior to analyses. The extensive DNA sequence analyses remain the gold standard for epidemiological investigations.CONCLUSIONS: Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are present in India. The Indian strains of HIV1 also show diverse subtypes with HIV1 subtype C predominance. Tracking the genetic diversity has implications towards understanding the evolution of the epidemic, immunopathogenesis, natural course of infection, response to therapy and most importantly vaccine design.",PMC4925574,10.1016/S0377-1237(05)80171-6,characterization;genome;diversity;outbreak;vaccine;phylogeny;surveillance,,Human Immunodeficy Virus,N,one figure but blurry and just a map with some annotations

We report that these changes represent both immune-driven selection and, in the absence of immune pressure, reversion toward an ancestral consensus. Sequence changes in hepatitis C virus (HCV) structural and nonstructural genes were studied in a cohort of women accidentally infected with HCV in a rare common-source outbreak. We compared sequences present in serum obtained 18-22 yr after infection to sequences present in the shared inoculum and found that HCV evolved along a distinct path in each woman. Amino acid substitutions in known epitopes were directed away from consensus in persons having the HLA allele associated with that epitope (immune selection), and toward consensus in those lacking the allele (reversion).

To obtain additional information regarding the content of the V. cholerae genome, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to prepare libraries of DNA sequences from two southern California coastal isolates which are divergent or absent in the clinical strain V. cholerae O1 El Tor N16961. More than 1,400 subtracted clones were sequenced. This revealed the presence of novel sequences encoding functions related to cell surface structures, transport, metabolism, signal transduction, luminescence, mobile elements, stress resistance, and virulence. Flanking sequence information was determined for loci of interest, and the distribution of these sequences was assessed for a collection of V. cholerae strains obtained from southern California and Mexican environments. This led to the surprising observation that sequences related to the toxin genes toxA, cnf1, and exoY are widespread and more common in these strains than those of the cholera toxin genes which are a hallmark of the pandemic strains of V. cholerae. Gene transfer among these strains could be facilitated by a 4.9-kbp plasmid discovered in one isolate, which possesses similarity to plasmids from other environmental vibrios. By investigating some of the nucleotide sequence basis for V. cholerae genotypic diversity, DNA fragments have been uncovered which could promote survival in coastal environments. Furthermore, a set of genes has been described which could be involved in as yet undiscovered interactions between V. cholerae and eukaryotic organisms.",PMC1082809,10.1128/JB.187.9.2992-3001.2005,mBio;characterization;genome;outbreak,,Vibrio cholerae,Y,

The gut microbial community (microbiota) is essential for processing dietary polysaccharides. We found that conventionalization of adult germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice with a normal microbiota harvested from the distal intestine (cecum) of conventionally raised animals produces a 60% increase in body fat content and insulin resistance within 14 days despite reduced food intake. Studies of GF and conventionalized mice revealed that the microbiota promotes absorption of monosaccharides from the gut lumen, with resulting induction of de novo hepatic lipogenesis. Fasting-induced adipocyte factor (Fiaf), a member of the angiopoietin-like family of proteins, is selectively suppressed in the intestinal epithelium of normal mice by conventionalization. Analysis of GF and conventionalized, normal and Fiaf knockout mice established that Fiaf is a circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibitor and that its suppression is essential for the microbiota-induced deposition of triglycerides in adipocytes. Studies of Rag1-/- animals indicate that these host responses do not require mature lymphocytes. Our findings suggest that the gut microbiota is an important environmental factor that affects energy harvest from the diet and energy storage in the host.

The recent emergence of this new pathogen, the careful tracing of its transmission patterns, and the ability to propagate in culture allows the exploration of the mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV in human populations.METHODS: We sequenced complete SARS-CoV genomes taken from primary human tissues (SIN3408, SIN3725V, SIN3765V), cultured isolates (SIN848, SIN846, SIN842, SIN845, SIN847, SIN849, SIN850, SIN852, SIN3408L), and five consecutive Vero cell passages (SIN2774_P1, SIN2774_P2, SIN2774_P3, SIN2774_P4, SIN2774_P5) arising from SIN2774 isolate. These represented individual patient samples, serial in vitro passages in cell culture, and paired human and cell culture isolates. Employing a refined mutation filtering scheme and constant mutation rate model, the mutation rates were estimated and the possible date of emergence was calculated. Phylogenetic analysis was used to uncover molecular relationships between the isolates.RESULTS: Close examination of whole genome sequence of 54 SARS-CoV isolates identified before 14th October 2003, including 22 from patients in Singapore, revealed the mutations engendered during human-to-Vero and Vero-to-human transmission as well as in multiple Vero cell passages in order to refine our analysis of human-to-human transmission. Though co-infection by different quasipecies in individual tissue samples is observed, the in vitro mutation rate of the SARS-CoV in Vero cell passage is negligible. The in vivo mutation rate, however, is consistent with estimates of other RNA viruses at approximately 5.7 x 10-6 nucleotide substitutions per site per day (0.17 mutations per genome per day), or two mutations per human passage (adjusted R-square = 0.4014). Using the immediate Hotel M contact isolates as roots, we observed that the SARS epidemic has generated four major genetic groups that are geographically associated: two Singapore isolates, one Taiwan isolate, and one North China isolate which appears most closely related to the putative SARS-CoV isolated from a palm civet. Non-synonymous mutations are centered in non-essential ORFs especially in structural and antigenic genes such as the S and M proteins, but these mutations did not distinguish the geographical groupings. However, no non-synonymous mutations were found in the 3CLpro and the polymerase genes.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the SARS-CoV is well adapted to growth in culture and did not appear to undergo specific selection in human populations. We further assessed that the putative origin of the SARS epidemic was in late October 2002 which is consistent with a recent estimate using cases from China. The greater sequence divergence in the structural and antigenic proteins and consistent deletions in the 3'--most portion of the viral genome suggest that certain selection pressures are interacting with the functional nature of these validated and putative ORFs.",PMC517714,10.1186/1471-2334-4-32,genome;phylogeny;transmission,,SARS Coronavirus,Y,

Serovars of Salmonella enterica carry variable assortments of phage-encoded virulence genes, suggesting that temperate phages play a pivotal role in this process. Epidemic isolates of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium are consistently lysogenic for two lambdoid phages, Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2, carrying known virulence genes. Other serovars of S. enterica, including serovars Dublin, Gallinarum, Enteritidis, and Hadar, carry distinct prophages with similarity to the Gifsy phages. In this study, we analyzed Gifsy-related loci from S. enterica serovar Abortusovis, a pathogen associated exclusively with ovine infection. A cryptic prophage, closely related to serovar Typhimurium phage Gifsy-2, was identified. This element, named Gifsy-2AO, was shown to contribute to serovar Abortusovis systemic infection in lambs. Sequence analysis of the prophage b region showed a large deletion which covers genes encoding phage tail fiber proteins and putative virulence factors, including type III secreted effector protein SseI (GtgB, SrfH). This deletion was identified in most of the serovar Abortusovis isolates tested and might be dependent on the replicative transposition of an adjacent insertion sequence, IS1414, previously identified in pathogenic Escherichia coli strains. IS1414 encodes heat-stable toxin EAST1 (astA) and showed multiple genomic copies in isolates of serovar Abortusovis. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of intergeneric transfer of virulence genes via insertion sequence elements in Salmonella. The acquisition of IS1414 (EAST1) and its frequent transposition within the chromosome might improve the fitness of serovar Abortusovis within its narrow ecological niche.",PMC438552,10.1128/JB.186.14.4568-4574.2004,clinical;diagnosis,,Escherichia coli;Salmonella Enterica,N,"mBio, lab pictures no tree"

Its genetic plasticity has facilitated the evolution of many virulent and drug-resistant strains, presenting a major and constantly changing clinical challenge. We sequenced the approximately 2.8-Mbp genomes of two disease-causing S. aureus strains isolated from distinct clinical settings: a recent hospital-acquired representative of the epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus EMRSA-16 clone (MRSA252), a clinically important and globally prevalent lineage; and a representative of an invasive community-acquired methicillin-susceptible S. aureus clone (MSSA476). A comparative-genomics approach was used to explore the mechanisms of evolution of clinically important S. aureus genomes and to identify regions affecting virulence and drug resistance. The genome sequences of MRSA252 and MSSA476 have a well conserved core region but differ markedly in their accessory genetic elements. MRSA252 is the most genetically diverse S. aureus strain sequenced to date: approximately 6% of the genome is novel compared with other published genomes, and it contains several unique genetic elements. MSSA476 is methicillin-susceptible, but it contains a novel Staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC) mec-like element (designated SCC(476)), which is integrated at the same site on the chromosome as SCCmec elements in MRSA strains but encodes a putative fusidic acid resistance protein. The crucial role that accessory elements play in the rapid evolution of S. aureus is clearly illustrated by comparing the MSSA476 genome with that of an extremely closely related MRSA community-acquired strain; the differential distribution of large mobile elements carrying virulence and drug-resistance determinants may be responsible for the clinically important phenotypic differences in these strains.",PMC470752,10.1073/pnas.0402521101,drug resistance;genome;diversity;mBio;characterization;outbreak;community;hospital,,Staphylococcus aureus,M,"mBio, a little old, but comparitive genomics is useful so I kept it"

Five viruses were isolated in Buenos Aires City from the 1999-2000 Paraguay outbreak. RT-PCRs obtained directly from plasma were cloned into pGemT vectors and sequences of the structural genes and NS1 were analyzed. Three viruses were full-length sequenced from RT-PCR obtained from cell-culture isolates. Excess of synonymous over non-synonymous mutations suggested that the structural proteins were under strong functional constraints while a weak purifying selection was operating in the whole polyprotein. Sequence diversity and selective pressures varied among patients but results were significantly above the procedure threshold. One sample showed small-plaque phenotype and impaired growth coupled to 3'untranslated region mutations. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length sequences split Buenos Aires isolates into two clusters within American DEN-1 genotype V: Clade I was phylogenetically linked to Brazilian samples and Clade II with samples from Paraguay and Northeastern Argentina.

The complete genome sequence of ZJ01 consisted of 29,715 bp (GenBank accession: AY297028, version: gi: 30910859). Seventeen SARS-associated coronavirus genome sequences in GenBank were compared to analyze the common sequence variations and the probability of co-occurrence of multiple polymorphisms or mutations. Phylogenetic analysis of those sequences was done.RESULTS: By bioinformatics processing and analysis, the 5 loci nucleotides at ZJ01 genome were found being T, T, G, T and T, respectively. Compared with other SARS-associated coronavirus genomes in the GenBank database, an A/G mutation was detected besides the other 4 mutation loci (C:G:C:C/T:T:T:T) involved in this genetic signature. Therefore a new definition was put forward according to the 5 mutation loci. SARS-associated coronavirus strains would be grouped into two genotypes (C:G:A:C:C/T:T:G:T:T), and abbreviated as SARS coronavirus C genotype and T genotype. On the basis of this new definition, the ZJ01 isolate belongs to SARS-associated coronavirus T genotype, first discovered and reported in mainland China. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein gene fragments of these SARS-associated coronavirus strains showed that the GZ01 isolate was phylogenetically distinct from other isolates, and compared with groups F1 and F2 of the T genotype, the isolates of BJ01 and CUHK-W1 were more closely related to the GZ01 isolate. It was interesting to find that two (A/G and C/T) of the five mutation loci occurred in the spike protein gene, which caused changes of Asp to Gly and Thr to Ile in the protein, respectively.CONCLUSION: Attention should be paid to whether these genotype and mutation patterns are related to the virus's biological activities,epidemic characteristics and host clinical symptoms.",NA,NA,genome;phylogeny,,SARS Coronavirus,N,not accessible from UBC

Numerous accessory polymorphisms were present in the protease, but none were located at drug-binding or active sites of the enzyme. One frequent polymorphism, I93L, was located near the protease/reverse transcriptase cleavage site.
