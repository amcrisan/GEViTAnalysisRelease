Lessons from comparative genomics.,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori, the human gastric pathogen, causes a variety of gastric diseases ranging from mild gastritis to gastric cancer. While the studies on H.Â pylori are dominated by those based on either East Asian or Western strains, information regarding H.Â pylori strains prevalent in the Middle East remains scarce. Therefore, we carried out whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis of three H.Â pylori strains isolated from three native Arab, Kuwaiti patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: H. pylori strains were sequenced using Illumina platform. The sequence reads were filtered and draft genomes were assembled and annotated. Various pathogenicity-associated regions and phages present within the genomes were identified. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out to determine the genetic relatedness of Kuwaiti strains to various lineages of H.Â pylori. The core genome content and virulence-related genes were analyzed to assess the pathogenic potential.RESULTS: The three genomes clustered along with HpEurope strains in the phylogenetic tree comprising various H.Â pylori lineages. A total of 1187 genes spread among various functional classes were identified in the core genome analysis. The three genomes possessed a complete cagPAI and also retained most of the known outer membrane proteins as well as virulence-related genes. The cagA gene in all three strains consisted of an AB-C type EPIYA motif.CONCLUSIONS: The comparative genomic analysis of Kuwaiti H.Â pylori strains revealed a European ancestry and a high pathogenic potential.",NA,NA,cancer;genome;phylogeny;characterization,Helicobacter pylori,10664596,N,23898187 had better visualizations

Here we sequenced the genomes of 97 H. pylori isolates from 52 members of two families living in rural conditions in South Africa. From each of 45 individuals, two H. pylori strains were isolated from the antrum and corpus parts of the stomach, and comparisons of their genomes enabled us to study within-host evolution. In 5 of these 45 hosts, the two genomes were too distantly related to be derived from each other and therefore represented evidence of multiple infections. From the remaining 40 genome pairs, we estimated that the synonymous mutation rate was 1.38 Ã— 10(-5) per site per year, with a low effective population size within host probably reflecting population bottlenecks and immune selection. Some individuals showed very little evidence for recombination, whereas in others, recombination introduced up to 100-times more substitutions than mutation. These differences may reflect unequal opportunities for recombination depending on the presence or absence of multiple infections. Comparing the genomes carried by distinct individuals enabled us to establish probable transmission links. Transmission events were found significantly more frequently between close relatives, and between individuals living in the same house. We found, however, that a majority of individuals (27/52) were not linked by transmission to other individuals. Our results suggest that transmission does not always occur within families, and that coinfection with multiple strains is frequent and evolutionarily important despite a fast turnover of the infecting strains within-host.",PMC3752273,10.1073/pnas.1304681110,outbreak;transmission;genome;characterization;phylogeny,Helicobacter pylori,10664596,Y,

Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of E. coli were assessed. All 38 cefotaxime-resistant (CTX-R) isolates were found to be extended-spectrum Î_-lactamase (ESBL)-positive by the double-disc synergy test. Thirty-two of those isolates produced enzymes of CTX-M-1 family, five of CTX-M-9 family, and one isolate both CTX-M types. Genotyping by multilocus sequence typing classified all ESBL-producing isolates into 13 sequence types (STs). ST131 was the most prevalent and was exclusively correlated with E. coli belonging to the more-virulent phylogroup B2. blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-9-like genes were mainly carried by plasmids belonging to the IncF group, while replicon I1 was predominant among CTX-M-1-encoding plasmids. Additionally, 63% of the ESBL-producing isolates were also resistant to ciprofloxacin. Sequence analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA and parC revealed the presence of amino acid substitutions in 22 out of 23 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. The acc(6')-Ib-cr and qnrB1 plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were also detected in some of the isolates.

Therefore, identification of blaCTX-M-15-positive lineages in food has a significant impact on public health. In this regard, until the end of 1990s, ESBL-producing isolates were mainly associated with hospital-acquired infections, with a predominance of SHV- and TEM-type enzymes. In recent years, a new trend has been observed among ESBL-producers, where most isolates now harbour CTX-M-type, being further isolated from community-acquired infections. Nowadays, CTX-M-15 has been recognised as the most important ESBL variant, invading virtually all human and animal compartments, leading to a global pandemic. Thus, whilst the rapid emergence and dissemination of CTX-M-15 among E. coli isolates has generated a large genetic reservoir from which other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family can easily acquire this resistance gene, there are an increasing number of new reservoirs and transmission mechanisms that must be investigated. In this study, we present the draft genome sequence of a CTX-M-15-producing E. coli ST345 isolated from commercial chicken meat in Brazil.

Several studies have demonstrated the presence of clusters of highly related HIV-1 sequences, particularly among recently HIV-infected individuals, which have been used to argue for a high transmission rate during acute infection. Using a large set of HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences collected from men who have sex with men, we demonstrate that virus from recent infections tend to be phylogenetically clustered at a greater rate than virus from patients with chronic infection ('excess clustering') and also tend to cluster with other recent HIV infections rather than chronic, established infections ('excess co-clustering'), consistent with previous reports. To determine the role that a higher infectivity during acute infection may play in excess clustering and co-clustering, we developed a simple model of HIV infection that incorporates an early period of intensified transmission, and explicitly considers the dynamics of phylogenetic clusters alongside the dynamics of acute and chronic infected cases. We explored the potential for clustering statistics to be used for inference of acute stage transmission rates and found that no single statistic explains very much variance in parameters controlling acute stage transmission rates. We demonstrate that high transmission rates during the acute stage is not the main cause of excess clustering of virus from patients with early/acute infection compared to chronic infection, which may simply reflect the shorter time since transmission in acute infection. Higher transmission during acute infection can result in excess co-clustering of sequences, while the extent of clustering observed is most sensitive to the fraction of infections sampled.",PMC3386305,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002552,outbreak;cluster,Human Immunodeficy Virus,10912282,Y,

However, there is no comprehensive data on the risk of transmission of dengue in the country. The objective of this study was to assess the risk of transmission of dengue in Dar es Salaam during the 2014 epidemic.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania during the dengue outbreak of 2014. The study involved Ilala, Kinondoni and Temeke districts. Adult mosquitoes were collected using carbon dioxide-propane powered Mosquito Magnet Liberty Plus traps. In each household compound, water-holding containers were examined for mosquito larvae and pupae. Dengue virus infection of mosquitoes was determined using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Partial amplification and sequencing of dengue virus genome in infected mosquitoes was performed. A total of 1,000 adult mosquitoes were collected. Over half (59.9%) of the adult mosquitoes were collected in Kinondoni. Aedes aegypti accounted for 17.2% of the mosquitoes of which 90.6% were from Kinondoni. Of a total of 796 houses inspected, 38.3% had water-holding containers in their premises. Kinondoni had the largest proportion of water-holding containers (57.7%), followed by Temeke (31.4%) and Ilala (23.4%). The most common breeding containers for the Aedes mosquitoes were discarded plastic containers and tires. High Aedes infestation indices were observed for all districts and sites, with a house index of 18.1% in Ilala, 25.5% in Temeke and 35.3% in Kinondoni. The respective container indices were 77.4%, 65.2% and 80.2%. Of the reared larvae and pupae, 5,250 adult mosquitoes emerged, of which 61.9% were Ae. aegypti. Overall, 27 (8.18) of the 330 pools of Ae. aegypti were positive for dengue virus. On average, the overall maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) indicates pooled infection rate of 8.49 per 1,000 mosquitoes (95%CI = 5.72-12.16). There was no significant difference in pooled infection rates between the districts. Dengue viruses in the tested mosquitoes clustered into serotype 2 cosmopolitan genotype.SIGNIFICANCE: Ae. aegypti is the main vector of dengue in Dar es Salaam and breeds mainly in medium size plastic containers and tires. The Aedes house indices were high, indicating that the three districts were at high risk of dengue transmission. The 2014 dengue outbreak was caused by Dengue virus serotype 2. The high mosquito larval and pupal indices in the area require intensification of vector surveillance along with source reduction and health education.",PMC4728062,10.1371/journal.pntd.0004313,clinical;diagnosis;outbreak;genotype;genome;vector,Dengue virus,11027645,N,22761556 was good enough

This is the first epidemic of dengue fever in Japan since 1945.METHODS: From August to October 2014, the following measures were taken to control the outbreak: 1) risk communication and information sharing; 2) active case finding; 3) vector surveillance in affected sites; and 4) laboratory testing. We also reviewed the surveillance data as reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases during the 44 epidemiological weeks. results: An official dengue fever call center was set up temporarily for the general public and 3,005 calls were received. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government issued 39 press releases regarding patients and nine related to dengue virus (DENV) detection and vector control activities for the media. Confirmed autochthonous dengue fever cases were reported between the 35th and 44th epidemiological weeks. Out of 160 cases of outbreak, 108 (67.5%) confirmed cases were reported in Tokyo. The estimated illness onset dates were between August 9 and October 7, and estimated dates of infections were between August 3 and October 3, 2014. The data suggest that the infective mosquitoes had already been present in Yoyogi Park at the end of July 2014. During the weekly vector surveillance at Yoyogi Park, a total of 1,152 adult mosquitoes, of which 856 (73.3%) were Aedes mosquitoes, were collected over 11 weeks by a light trap with dry ice. DENV was detected from adult Aedes mosquito samples collected on the 2nd, 9th, and 16th of September, 2014. Serum samples from 240 suspected cases were examined at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health, and 78 were positive for the DENV NS1 antigen, DENV-specific IgM antibody, or DENV nucleic acid with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (NS1: 66 cases; IgM: 50 cases; PCR: 57 cases). Genetic analysis of DENV-positive serum and mosquito samples found all to be categorized as DENV-serotype 1 (gene type I). Phylogenetic analysis of the envelope protein genome sequence from patients and mosquitoes in Tokyo revealed more than 99% similarity with each other and with the strain from the first outbreak-associated patient in Saitama.CONCLUSION: Measures important for control of infectious disease epidemic were learned during this recent indigenous dengue outbreak in Tokyo. It also highlighted the importance of preparedness for epidemics of indigenous or imported infectious diseases, especially in light of the fact that Tokyo is in preparation for the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020.",NA,NA,characterization;clinical;diagnosis;phylogeny;outbreak;genome,Dengue virus,11027645,N,English Version not accessible

However, there still exists a lack of information concerning the Vibrio cholerae O1 lineages driving early and contemporary epidemics since the seventh cholera pandemic started in the continent. This compromises the understanding of the forces determining the epidemiology of cholera in Africa and its control. This study aimed to analyze a collection of V. cholerae O1 strains from the beginning of the seventh cholera pandemic in Ghana and to compare them with recent isolates to understand the evolution of the cholera epidemic in Ghana. V. cholerae O1 strains were characterized by means of Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA), genes from the virulence core genome (VCG), and genes related to the choleragenic phenotype. Our results revealed two major clusters of Ghanaian V. cholerae O1 strains, El Tor and Amazonia/Ghana. Concerning the virulence genes, all strains harbored the set of VCG and most were positive for VSP-II genomic island. The ctxB gene of the contemporary strains was characterized as Altered El Tor. The strains from 1970 to 1980 were susceptible to all antibiotics tested, except for the Amazonia/Ghana cluster that was resistant to aminoglycosides and carried the class 2 integron with the sat2-aadA1 arrangement. This study showed that distinct V. cholerae O1 were the determinants of cholera outbreaks in Ghana.

We compared this data set with ToxT binding sites determined by pulldown and deep sequencing to identify sRNA promoters directly controlled by ToxT. Analysis of the resulting transcripts with ToxT binding sites in cis revealed two sRNAs within the Vibrio Pathogenicity Island. When deletions of these sRNAs were made and the resulting strains were competed against the parental strain in the infant mouse model of V. cholerae colonization, one, TarB, displayed a variable colonization phenotype dependent on its physiological state at the time of inoculation. We identified a target of TarB as the mRNA for the secreted colonization factor, TcpF. We verified negative regulation of TcpF expression by TarB and, using point mutations that disrupted interaction between TarB and tpcF mRNA, showed that loss of this negative regulation was primarily responsible for the colonization phenotype observed in the TarB deletion mutant.",PMC3136459,10.1371/journal.ppat.1002126,genome;drug resistance,Vibrio cholerae,11220978,N,"Lab heavy paper, mostly gels & stat plots"

To address this situation we conducted a molecular epidemiological survey of HCV and HPgV (previously named GB Virus C or hepatitis G virus) in samples collected in 2007 from 299 males from the DRC, whose ages ranged from 21 to 71 years old. Samples were tested for the presence of HCV antibodies by ELISA and reactive samples were subsequently tested for HCV RNA using RT-PCR in which both the HCV Core and NS5B genome regions were amplified. Remaining samples were tested for HPgV RNA and the HPgV NS3 genome region of positive samples was amplified. For HCV, 13.7% of the samples were seropositive (41/299) but only 3.7% were viremic (11/299). HPgV RNA was found in 12.7% (33/259) of samples. HCV viremia was strongly associated with age; the percentage of samples that contained detectable HCV RNA was ~0.5% in those younger than 50 and 13% in those older than 50. Our study represents the first systematic survey of HCV genetic diversity in the DRC. HCV sequences obtained belonged to diverse lineages of genotype 4, including subtypes 4c, 4 k, 4 l and 4r, plus one unclassified lineage that may constitute a new subtype. These data suggest that HCV in the DRC exhibits an age 'cohort effect', as has been recently reported in neighbouring countries, and are consistent with the hypothesis that HCV transmission rates were higher in the mid-twentieth century, possibly as a result of parenteral, iatrogenic, or other unidentified factors.

Our analysis found that with the addition of Sahul64 to the 38 genomes, the core genome content of H. pylori is reduced by approximately 14% (âˆ_170 genes) and the pan-genome has expanded from 2,070 to 2,238 genes. We have identified three putative horizontally acquired regions, including one that is likely to have been acquired from the closely related Helicobacter cetorum prior to speciation.

One profile, or single locus variants of it, was present in 249 (52%) isolates but was not common previously. These cases represented a national increase in PT8, associated epidemiologically with soil-contaminated vegetables. Most of the 177 other MLVA profiles were unique to a single isolate. Profiles shared by &gt;1 isolate included cases from two small community, food-borne outbreaks and 11 households. Several shared profiles were found among 23 isolates without known links. Apart from one group, isolates linked to travel abroad had very diverse profiles.CONCLUSIONS: Multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis discriminated apparent sporadic isolates of the same PT and assisted in detection of cases in an emerging national outbreak.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis is an epidemiologically valid complement to surveillance and applicable as a rapid, practical test for large numbers of isolates.",NA,NA,vector;genotype,Escherichia coli,11996687,Y,

However, the circulation of HBV A/G recombinants remains poorly understood. This molecular epidemiologic study examined HBV A/G recombinants in Japanese HIV-1-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Initially, blood specimens submitted for confirmatory tests of HIV infection in Osaka and Tokyo, Japan, from 2006 to 2013 were examined for HIV-1, and HIV-1-positive specimens were screened for HBV. Among 817 specimens from HIV-1-positive individuals, HBsAg was detected in 59 specimens; of these, HBV/Ae (alternatively A2), a subgenotype of HBV/A prevalent in Europe and North America, was identified in 70.2%, HBV/C in 17.5%, and HBV/G in 10.5%, and HBV/E in 1.8% according to the core gene sequence. The full-length genome analysis of HBV was performed on HBV/G-positive specimens because some HBV A/G recombinants were historically overlooked by genotyping based on a partial genome analysis. It revealed that five of the specimens contained novel Ae/G recombinants, the core gene of which had a high sequence similarity to HBV/G. Detailed analyses showed that novel recombinants were coinfected with HBV/Ae in a recombinant-dominant fashion. No major drug-resistant mutations were found in the newly identified HBV Ae/G recombinants. Some of the individuals asymptomatically coinfected with HIV/HBV suffered mild liver injury. This study demonstrated that novel Ae/G HBV recombinants were identified in Japanese HIV-1-positive MSM. The pathogenicity of novel HBV Ae/G recombinants should be examined in a future longitudinal study.

In the present study, a total of 168 serum samples from treatment-naive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients were collected, and the RT region of HBV polymerase was sequenced. The results showed that pre-existing mutations in the RT region of HBV polymerase were detected in 43 of 168 (25.6%) treatment-naive CHB patients within which there were no well-characterized primary nucleotide analogs (NAs) resistance sites.

No significant correlation was found between pre-existing mutations and gender, age, HBV genotype, ALT, HBeAg or HBV DNA loads. However, patients with pre-existing RT mutations under HBeAg sero-negative status exhibited decreased HBV DNA loads, which contributed to the decreased HBV DNA loads in the total HBeAg sero-negative patients. The above investigation indicated that there was a prevalence of pre-existing mutations in RT region of HBV polymerase which might affect the serum HBV DNA level in treatment-naive CHB patients.

Presence of unique amino acid residues and non-conservative substitutions in critical amino acid residues of major structural and non-structural proteins was observed in recent Indian DENV-2. Selection pressure analysis revealed positive selection in few amino acid sites of the genes encoding for structural and non-structural proteins.

The aim of this study was to generate high-quality genome sequences for 7 isolates of the Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) from the United Kingdom and Canada representing different virulence characteristics in order to: (1) associate comparative genomics results with virulence factor variability and (2) identify genomic and/or phenotypic divergence between the two geographical locations. We performed phenotypic characterization of pyoverdine, pyocyanin, motility, biofilm formation, and proteolytic activity. We also assessed the degree of virulence using the Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba model. Comparative genomics analysis revealed at least one large deletion (40-50 kb) in 6 out of the 7 isolates compared to the reference genome of LESB58. These deletions correspond to prophages, which are known to increase the competitiveness of LESB58 in chronic lung infection. We also identified 308 non-synonymous polymorphisms, of which 28 were associated with virulence determinants and 52 with regulatory proteins. At the phenotypic level, isolates showed extensive variability in production of pyocyanin, pyoverdine, proteases and biofilm as well as in swimming motility, while being predominantly avirulent in the amoeba model. Isolates from the two continents were phylogenetically and phenotypically undistinguishable. Most regulatory mutations were isolate-specific and 29% of them were predicted to have high functional impact.

Trovagene HPV test results on urine samples were compared with cervical and urine testing by Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test (LA-HPV) for detection of histologically-confirmed cervical precancerous lesions.RESULTS: There was high concordance between urine samples tested by the Trovagene HPV test and corresponding cervical (87.5%) and urine (81.9%) samples tested by LA-HPV. The Trovagene HPV test had high sensitivity (92.3% for detecting CIN2/3, and 100% for CIN3), comparable to LA-HPV testing on cervical samples (96.0% and 100%, respectively), and higher than LA-HPV testing on urine samples (80.8% and 90.0%, respectively). In this referral population, the specificity of the Trovagene urine HPV test was non-significantly lower (29% for CIN2/3 and 25% for CIN3) than corresponding estimates of LA-HPV testing on cervical (36% and 28%, respectively) and urine (42% and 38%, respectively) samples.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that the Trovagene HPV test has high sensitivity for urine-based detection of cervical precancer and merits evaluation in larger studies.",PMC4146457,10.1016/j.jcv.2014.04.016,genotype;clinical;genome,Human Papillomavirus,12918070,N,no figures

Since new screening and prevention strategies, namely improved HPV testing and HPV vaccination have been aggressively promoted recently, it is crucial to investigate the HPV distribution in Malaysia in order to maximize their cost-effectiveness. This study was therefore conducted to assess the HPV type distribution in the most populous region, the state of Selangor. A total of 200 cervical swab samples were collected in two health-screening campaigns, and also from women attending obstetrics and gynecology clinics in several hospitals in Selangor. DNA extraction was performed and HPV DNA was detected via nested PCR using MY09/MY11 as outer primers and GP5+/GP6+ as inner primers which target the L1 gene of the viral genome. The purified PCR products were subjected to automated DNA sequencing to determine the HPV genotype. Out of 180 Î_-globin positive samples, 84 (46.7%) were positive for HPV DNA. The most common HPV type found was high-risk oncogenic type 16 (40%), followed by HPV type 18 (3.3%), HPV 33 (1.7%), HPV 31 (0.6%), and low-risk HPV 87 (0.6%). Our study confirmed that nested PCR method is highly sensitive in detecting HPV DNA even in low risk patients. Since a relatively high prevalence rate of HPV infection was found in this population, prompt healthcare policy changes to bring about implementation of early HPV vaccination program is desirable to prevent a high incidence of cervical cancer.",NA,NA,genotype;clinical;diagnosis;genome;characterization;vaccine,Human Papillomavirus,12918070,N,no figures

Consensus dromedary MERS-CoV genome sequences were the same with either template source and identical to published human MERS-CoV sequences. However, in contrast to individual human cases, where only clonal genomic sequences are reported, detailed population analyses revealed the presence of more than one genomic variant in individual dromedaries. If humans are truly infected only with clonal virus populations, we must entertain a model for interspecies transmission of MERS-CoV wherein only specific genotypes are capable of passing bottleneck selection. IMPORTANCE In most cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the route for human infection with the causative agent, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is unknown. Antibodies to and viral nucleic acids of MERS-CoV have been found in dromedaries, suggesting the possibility that they may serve as a reservoir or vector for human infection. However, neither whole viral genomic sequence nor infectious virus has been isolated from dromedaries or other animals in Saudi Arabia. Here, we report recovery of MERS-CoV from nasal swabs of dromedaries, demonstrate that MERS-CoV whole-genome consensus sequences from dromedaries and humans are indistinguishable, and show that dromedaries can be simultaneously infected with more than one MERS-CoV. Together with data indicating widespread dromedary infection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, these findings support the plausibility of a role for dromedaries in human infection.",PMC4010836,10.1128/mBio.01146-14,genome,SARS Coronavirus;MERS coronavirus,14527350,Y,

However, most studies have analyzed the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs, precluding an investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed non-consensus sequences to characterize intrapatient heterogeneity in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing. A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity. Based on the analysis of non-consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen. The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections. Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% Â± 1.9% on average). Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% Â± 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak.",PMC5111008,10.1101/mcs.a001214,genome,SARS Coronavirus;MERS coronavirus,14527350,N,24781747 better

Toxigenic O1 and O139 V. cholerae strains have caused cholera epidemics and pandemics, whereas the nontoxigenic strains within these serogroups only occasionally lead to disease. To understand the differences in the genome and clonality between the toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of V. cholerae serogroups O1 and O139, we employed a whole genome PCR scanning (WGPScanning) method, an rrn operon-mediated fragment rearrangement analysis and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to analyze the genome structure of different strains. WGPScanning in conjunction with CGH revealed that the genomic contents of the toxigenic strains were conservative, except for a few indels located mainly in mobile elements. Minor nucleotide variation in orthologous genes appeared to be the major difference between the toxigenic strains. rrn operon-mediated rearrangements were infrequent in El Tor toxigenic strains tested using I-CeuI digested pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis and PCR analysis based on flanking sequence of rrn operons. Using these methods, we found that the genomic structures of toxigenic El Tor and O139 strains were syntenic. The nontoxigenic strains exhibited more extensive sequence variations, but toxin coregulated pilus positive (TCP+) strains had a similar structure. TCP+ nontoxigenic strains could be subdivided into multiple lineages according to the TCP type, suggesting the existence of complex intermediates in the evolution of toxigenic strains. The data indicate that toxigenic O1 El Tor and O139 strains were derived from a single lineage of intermediates from complex clones in the environment. The nontoxigenic strains with non-El Tor type TCP may yet evolve into new epidemic clones after attaining toxigenic attributes.",PMC3164192,10.1371/journal.pone.0024267,characterization;clinical;diagnosis;genome,Vibrio cholerae,14568156,N,26828665 better

Since the latter of the 1990s, G3 human rotaviruses referred to as &quot;new variant G3&quot; have emerged and spread in China, being a dominant genotype until 2010, although their genomic evolution has not yet been well investigated.METHODS: The complete genomes of 33 G3P[8] human rotavirus strains detected in Wuhan, China, from 2000 through 2013 were analyzed. Phylogenetic trees of concatenated sequences of all the RNA segments and individual genes were constructed together with published rotavirus sequences.RESULTS: Genotypes of 11 gene segments of all the 33 strains were assigned to G3-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1, belonging to Wa genogroup. Phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated full genome sequences indicated that all the modern G3P[8] strains were assigned to Cluster 2 containing only one clade of G3P[8] strains in the US detected in the 1970s, which was distinct from Cluster 1 comprising most of old G3P[8] strains. While main lineages of all the 11 gene segments persisted during the study period, different lineages appeared occasionally in RNA segments encoding VP1, VP4, VP6, and NSP1-NSP5, exhibiting various allele constellations. In contrast, only a single lineage was detected for VP7, VP2, and VP3 genes. Remarkable lineage shift was observed for NSP1 gene; lineage A1-2 emerged in 2007 and became dominant in 2008-2009 epidemic season, while lineage A1-1 persisted throughout the study period.CONCLUSION: Chinese G3P[8] rotavirus strains have evolved since 2000 by intra-genogroup reassortment with co-circulating strains, accumulating more reassorted genes over the years.

Examples from human strains were limited to seven strains, 69M, 57M, B37, Mc345, AU19, B4106 and BE2001, which have a variety of G and P genotypes. AU19 is a rare G1P[6] human rotavirus strain detected in a Japanese infant with severe acute gastroenteritis. This study was undertaken to better understand the origin of AU19 by determining the genotype constellation of AU19. Upon nearly-full genome sequencing, AU19 had a G1-P[6]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H2 genotype constellation. Possession of I5 and A8 genotypes is indicative of its porcine rotavirus origin, whereas possession of H2 genotype is indicative of its DS-1 like human rotavirus origin. At the phylogenetic lineage level for the genome segments that share the genotype between porcine and human rotaviruses, the VP1-4, VP7, NSP3-4 genes were most closely related to those of porcine rotaviruses, but the origin of the NSP2 gene was inconclusive. As to the NSP5 gene, the lineage containing AU19 and the other three super-short human strains, 69M, 57M and B37, carrying the H2 genotype (H2b) clustered with the lineage to which DS-1- like short strains belonged (H2a) albeit with an insignificant bootstrap support. Taken all these observations together, AU19 was likely to emerge as a consequence of interspecies transmission of a porcine rotavirus to a child coupled with the acquisition of a rare H2b genotype by genetic reassortment probably from a co-circulating human strain. The addition of the AU19 NSP5 sequence to much homogeneous H2b genotypes shared by previous super-short rotavirus strains made the genetic diversity of H2b genotypes as diverse as that of the H2a genotype, lending support to the hypothesis that super-short strains carrying H2b genotype have long been circulating unnoticed in the human population.",NA,NA,outbreak;characterization;genotype;genome;diversity;transmission,Human rotavirus,15027000,N,24676363 better

On the basis of genomic variations, each serotype is classified further into its genotypes. Epidemiological studies have shown that the emergence of a newer dengue serotype/genotype after an interval always leads to a major outbreak; therefore a continuous epidemiological surveillance is needed to monitor the epidemiology of dengue viruses. The present study was planned to identify the serotype/genotype of dengue viruses circulating in Uttar Pradesh, India.

More than 4000 illnesses and 50 deaths were reported. The outbreak strain was a typical enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) that acquired an antibiotic resistance plasmid and a Shiga-toxin 2 (Stx2)-encoding bacteriophage. Based on whole-genome phylogenies, the O104:H4 strain was most closely related to other EAEC strains; however, Stx2-bacteriophage are mobile, and do not necessarily share an evolutionary history with their bacterial host. In this study, we analyzed Stx2-bacteriophage from the E. coli O104:H4 outbreak isolates and compared them to all available Stx2-bacteriophage sequences. We also compared Stx2 production by an E. coli O104:H4 outbreak-associated isolate (ON-2011) to that of E. coli O157:H7 strains EDL933 and Sakai. Among the E. coli Stx2-phage sequences studied, that from O111:H- strain JB1-95 was most closely related phylogenetically to the Stx2-phage from the O104:H4 outbreak isolates. The phylogeny of most other Stx2-phage was largely concordant with their bacterial host genomes. Finally, O104:H4 strain ON-2011 produced less Stx2 than E. coli O157:H7 strains EDL933 and Sakai in culture; however, when mitomycin C was added, ON-2011 produced significantly more toxin than the E. coli O157:H7 strains. The Stx2-phage from the E. coli O104:H4 outbreak strain and the Stx2-phage from O111:H- strain JB1-95 likely share a common ancestor. Incongruence between the phylogenies of the Stx2-phage and their host genomes suggest the recent Stx2-phage acquisition by E. coli O104:H4. The increase in Stx2-production by ON-2011 following mitomycin C treatment may or may not be related to the high rates of hemolytic uremic syndrome associated with the German outbreak strain.

A gerbil-adapted H. pylori strain, HP87 P7, showed energy-dependent behavior, while its isogenic tlpD mutant lost it. A TlpD-complemented strain regained the wild-type phenotype. Infection of gerbils with the complemented strain demonstrated that TlpD is important for persistent infection in the antrum and corpus and suggested a role of TlpD in horizontal navigation and persistent corpus colonization.

The majority of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE(fm)) connected to outbreaks worldwide pertains to the clonal complex 17 (CC17). In Brazil, the majority of VRE(fm) involved in outbreaks reported so far are not related to CC17. VRE(fm) strains responsible for an outbreak and sporadic cases in hospitals located in the city of Campinas, Brazil, were compared to other VRE(fm) strains in the country. Twenty-two out of 23 E.Â faecium were vancomycin-resistant and harboured the vanA gene. One vancomycin-susceptible E.Â faecium (VSE(fm)) strain was included in this study because it was isolated from a patient who one week later harboured a VRE(fm). All strains, except VSE, showed the same alteration in the VanA element characterised by deletion of the left extremity of the transposon and insertion of IS1251 between the vanS and vanH genes. Genes codifying virulence factors such as collagen-adhesin protein, enterococcal surface protein and hyaluronidase were detected in the VRE(fm) and VSE(fm) studied. Both pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that VRE(fm) and VSE(fm) strains have a clonal relationship. New sequence types (STs) were identified by MLST as ST447, ST448, ST478 and ST412 but all belonged to the CC17. The present study revealed that VRE(fm) outbreaks in Brazil were caused by strains that did not share a common evolutionary history, and that VRE(fm) strains belonging to CC17 could be predominant in Brazil as in other countries.",NA,NA,drug resistance;phylogeny;mBio;genotype,Enterococcus faecium,15256026,,

We analyzed HIV diversity in Black men who have sex with men who were enrolled in the HIV Prevention Trials Network 061 study.METHODS: A high resolution melting (HRM) diversity assay was used to measure diversity in six regions of the HIV genome: two in gag, one in pol, and three in env. HIV diversity was analyzed for 146 men who were HIV infected at study enrollment, including three with acute infection and 13 with recent infection (identified using a multi-assay algorithm), and for 21 men who seroconverted during the study. HIV diversification was analyzed in a paired analysis for 62 HIV-infected men using plasma samples from the enrollment and 12-month (end of study) visits.RESULTS: Men with acute or recent infection at enrollment and seroconverters had lower median HRM scores (lower HIV diversity) than men with non-recent infection in all six regions analyzed. In univariate analyses, younger age, higher CD4 cell count, and HIV drug resistance were associated with lower median HRM scores in multiple regions; ARV drug detection was marginally associated with lower diversity in the pol region. In multivariate analysis, acute or recent infection (all six regions) and HIV drug resistance (both gag regions) were associated with lower median HRM scores. Diversification in the pol region over 12 months was greater for men with acute or recent infection, higher CD4 cell count, and lower HIV viral load at study enrollment.CONCLUSIONS: HIV diversity was significantly associated with duration of HIV infection, and lower gag diversity was observed in men who had HIV drug resistance.

Although, majority NAT assays were designed to detect the conserved regions of HIV-1 mutations at the primer or probe binding regions may lead to false negatives. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of detecting two genomic targets for enhanced sensitivity. A total of 180 tests using HIV-1 VQA RNA quantitation standard, 240 tests using EQAPOL HIV-1 viral diversity subtype panel, and 30 clinical plasma samples from Cameroon were evaluated. The analysis was based on probit and hit rate. The genomic targets LOD estimated by PROBIT for the gag target was 118 cps/ml (95%CI 64 cps/ml lower bound), Pol or POL/LTR was at 40 cps/ml (95%CI 17, 16 cps/ml), LTR 45 cps/ml (95%CI 20 cps/ml lower bound), and Gag/LTR at 67.8 cps/ml (95%CI 32 cps/ml lower bound). For HIV-1 subtypes the overall reactivity was 55-100% when tested at 100 and 1000 cps/ml and combination of genomic targets detection increased the reactivity to 100%. The plasma samples evaluation showed LTR or pol/LTR combination yielded higher sensitivity for patients with lower viral load (&lt;40 cps/ml).

Isolates from 12 infants and 7 environmental samples were sequenced. All but one of the clinical isolates clustered in ST253 and no differences were detected between unmapped reads. The environmental isolates revealed a variety of sequence types, indicating a large diverse bioburden within the unit, which was subsequently confirmed via enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction typing of post-outbreak isolates.

The emergence of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technologies has enabled the development of genome-based methods applicable for routine typing and surveillance of bacterial pathogens. In this study, we developed the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotyper (PAst) program, which enabled in silico serotyping of P. aeruginosa isolates using WGS data. PAst has been made publically available as a web service and aptly facilitates high-throughput serotyping analysis. The program overcomes critical issues such as the loss of in vitro typeability often associated with P. aeruginosa isolates from chronic infections and quickly determines the serogroup of an isolate based on the sequence of the O-specific antigen (OSA) gene cluster. Here, PAst analysis of 1,649 genomes resulted in successful serogroup assignments in 99.27% of the cases. This frequency is rarely achievable by conventional serotyping methods. The limited number of nontypeable isolates found using PAst was the result of either a complete absence of OSA genes in the genomes or the artifact of genomic misassembly. With PAst, P. aeruginosa serotype data can be obtained from WGS information alone. PAst is a highly efficient alternative to conventional serotyping methods in relation to outbreak surveillance of serotype O12 and other high-risk clones, while maintaining backward compatibility to historical serotype data.",PMC4922119,10.1128/JCM.00349-16,cluster;control;genome,Pseudomona aeruginosa,15583294,,

Phylogenetic and network analysis was performed to infer putative relationships between HIV sequences. Correlates of identified clusters were evaluated and spatiotemporal relationships were explored using Bayesian phylogeographic analysis.FINDINGS: After quality filtering, 843 HIV sequences with associated demographic data and 263 background sequences from the region were analyzed, and 138 clusters were inferred (2-23 individuals). Overall, the rate of clustering did not differ by ethnicity, residence, or sex, but bisexuals were less likely to cluster than heterosexuals or men who have sex with men (p = 0.043), and individuals identifying as white (p â‰_ 0.01) were more likely to cluster than other races.

HIV phylogeny can provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying HIV transmission networks in communities.METHODS: To reconstruct the structure and dynamics of a local HIV/AIDS epidemic, the phylogenetic relatedness of HIV-1 subtype C env sequences obtained from 785 HIV-infected community residents in the northeastern sector of Mochudi, Botswana, during 2010-2013 was estimated. The genotyping coverage was estimated at 44%. Clusters were defined based on relatedness of HIV-1C env sequences and bootstrap support of splits.RESULTS: The overall proportion of clustered HIV-1C env sequences was 19.1% (95% CI 17.5% to 20.8%). The proportion of clustered sequences from Mochudi was significantly higher than the proportion of non-Mochudi sequences that clustered, 27.0% vs. 14.7% (pâ€_=â€_5.8E-12; Fisher exact test). The majority of clustered Mochudi sequences (90.1%; 95% CI 85.1% to 93.6%) were found in the Mochudi-unique clusters.

Seven of 20 genotyped seroconverters were found in 7 distinct clusters.CONCLUSIONS: The study provides essential characteristics of the HIV transmission network in a community in Botswana, suggests the importance of high sampling coverage, and highlights the need for broad HIV genotyping to determine the spread of community-unique and community-mixed viral variants circulating in local epidemics. The proposed methodology of cluster analysis enumerates circulating HIV variants and can work well for surveillance of HIV transmission networks.

Phylogenetic analysis showed no HIV-1 clustering according to the duration of infection and risk groups but revealed different epidemic networks confirming that HIV infection spread within local epidemic foci. A high incidence of CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 variants and a higher rate of secondary mutations influencing the virus fitness (K20R, L10V, and I) are observed among the virus specimens isolated from newly infected individuals.

Due to its geographic location, Dehong contributed greatly in bridging HIV-1 epidemics in Southeast Asia and China through drug trafficking and injection drug use; and also extensively to the HIV genetic diversity in Yunnan and China. We attempt to monitor HIV-1 in this area by studying the HIV-1 genetic distribution and transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in various at-risk populations.METHODS: Blood samples from a total of 320 newly HIV-1 diagnosed individuals, who were antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, were collected from January 2009 to December 2010 in 2 counties in Dehong. HIV-1 subtypes and pol gene drug resistance (DR) mutations were genotyped.RESULTS: Among 299 pol sequences successfully genotyped (93.4%), subtype C accounted for 43.1% (n=129), unique recombinant forms (URFs) for 18.4% (n=55), CRF01_AE for 17.7% (n=54), B for 10.7% (n=32), CRF08_BC for 8.4% (n=25) and CRF07_BC for 1.7% (n=5). Subtype distribution in patients infected by different transmission routes varied. In contract to the previous finding of CRF01_AE predominance in 2002-2006, subtype C predominated in both injecting drug users (IDUs) and heterosexually transmitted populations in this study. Furthermore, we found a high level of BC, CRF01_AE/C and CRF01_AE/B/C recombinants suggesting the presence of active viral recombination in the area. TDR associated mutations were identified in 4.3% (n=13) individuals. A total of 1.3% of DR were related to protease inhibitors (PIs), including I85IV, M46I and L90M; 0.3% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including M184I; and 2.7% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including K103N/S, Y181C, K101E and G190A.CONCLUSION: Our work revealed diverse HIV-1 subtype distributions and intersubtype recombinations. We also identified a low but significant TDR mutation rate among ART-naive patients.

Bats are likely the natural reservoir of alpha- and betacoronaviruses, and due to the rich diversity and global distribution of bats, the number of bat coronaviruses will likely increase. We conducted a surveillance of coronaviruses in bats in an abandoned mineshaft in Mojiang County, Yunnan Province, China, from 2012-2013. Six bat species were frequently detected in the cave: Rhinolophus sinicus, Rhinolophus affinis, Hipposideros pomona, Miniopterus schreibersii, Miniopterus fuliginosus, and Miniopterus fuscus. By sequencing PCR products of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp), we found a high frequency of infection by a diverse group of coronaviruses in different bat species in the mineshaft. Sequenced partial RdRp fragments had 80%-99% nucleic acid sequence identity with well-characterized Alphacoronavirus species, including BtCoV HKU2, BtCoV HKU8, and BtCoV1, and unassigned species BtCoV HKU7 and BtCoV HKU10. Additionally, the surveillance identified two unclassified betacoronaviruses, one new strain of SARS-like coronavirus, and one potentially new betacoronavirus species. Furthermore, coronavirus co-infection was detected in all six bat species, a phenomenon that fosters recombination and promotes the emergence of novel virus strains.

We captured 266 Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus) in Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces, China, during 2013-2015. Coronavirus (CoV) RNA was detected in 24 Asian house shrews, with an overall prevalence of 9.02%. Complete viral genome sequences were successfully recovered from the RNA positive samples. The newly discovered shrew CoV fell into four lineages reflecting their geographic origins, indicative of largely allopatric evolution. Notably, these viruses were most closely related to alphacoronaviruses, but sufficiently divergent that they should be considered a novel member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, which we denote WÃ©nchÃ©ng shrew virus (WESV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that WESV was a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and, more dramatically, that the S gene of WESV fell in a cluster that was genetically distinct from that of known coronaviruses. The divergent position of WESV suggests that coronaviruses have a long association with Asian house shrews. In addition, the genome of WESV contains a distinct NS7 gene that exhibits no sequence similarity to any known viruses. Together, these data suggest that shrews are natural reservoirs for coronaviruses and may have played an important and long-term role in CoV evolution.IMPORTANCE The subfamily Coronavirinae contains several notorious human and animal pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Because of their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships it has been proposed that the alphacoronaviruses likely have their ultimate ancestry in those viruses residing in bats. Here, we described a novel alphacoronavirus (WÃ©nchÃ©ng shrew virus, WESV) that was sampled from Asian house shrews in China. Notably, WESV is a highly divergent member of the alphacoronaviruses and possesses an S gene that is genetically distinct from that of all known coronaviruses.

At entry into prenatal care, the mean CD4 cell count for this cohort of patients was 406 cells/mm(3) (95% CI: 373-438 cells/mm(3)), while the mean HIV RNA was 24,394 copies/ml (95% CI: 18,275-30,513 copies/ml). Thirty-six women (16%) had detectable antiretroviral-resistant mutations. By 34 weeks gestation, 75% had achieved HIV RNA &lt;400 copies/ml. Our logistic regression model showed the odds of harbouring antiretroviral-resistant virus with a baseline CD4 cell count of &lt;200 cells/mm(3) was eight times that of subjects with CD4 cell counts &gt;500 CD4 cells/mm(3) (95% CI 1.5-42.73). Six infants were HIV infected, four born to mothers with detectable viraemia at 34 weeks and two born to mothers who were lost to follow up. Antiretroviral resistance is common in prenatal care but did not increase vertical transmission if viral load was appropriately suppressed.

Although a dysbiotic gut microbiota has recently been reported in HIV+ individuals, the metagenome gene pool associated with HIV infection remains unknown. The aim of this study is to characterize the functional gene content of gut microbiota in HIV+ patients and to define the metabolic pathways of this bacterial community, which is potentially associated with immune dysfunction. We determined systemic markers of innate and adaptive immunity in a cohort of HIV-infected individuals on successful antiretroviral therapy without comorbidities and in healthy non-HIV-infected subjects. Metagenome sequencing revealed an altered functional profile, with enrichment of the genes involved in various pathogenic processes, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, bacterial translocation, and other inflammatory pathways. In contrast, we observed depletion of genes involved in amino acid metabolism and energy processes. Bayesian networks showed significant interactions between the bacterial community, their altered metabolic pathways, and systemic markers of immune dysfunction. This study reveals altered metabolic activity of microbiota and provides novel insight into the potential host-microbiota interactions driving the sustained inflammatory state in successfully treated HIV-infected patients.",NA,NA,clinical;treatment,Human Immunodeficy Virus,16280702,,

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV was identified as the etiologic agent of the 2002-2003 international SARS outbreak. Yet, how SARS evades innate immune responses to cause human disease remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that a protein encoded by SARS-CoV designated as open reading frame-9b (ORF-9b) localizes to mitochondria and causes mitochondrial elongation by triggering ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of dynamin-like protein 1, a host protein involved in mitochondrial fission. Also, acting on mitochondria, ORF-9b targets the mitochondrial-associated adaptor molecule MAVS signalosome by usurping PCBP2 and the HECT domain E3 ligase AIP4 to trigger the degradation of MAVS, TRAF3, and TRAF 6. This severely limits host cell IFN responses. Reducing either PCBP2 or AIP4 expression substantially reversed the ORF-9b-mediated reduction of MAVS and the suppression of antiviral transcriptional responses. Finally, transient ORF-9b expression led to a strong induction of autophagy in cells. The induction of autophagy depended upon ATG5, a critical autophagy regulator, but the inhibition of MAVS signaling did not. These results indicate that SARS-CoV ORF-9b manipulates host cell mitochondria and mitochondrial function to help evade host innate immunity. This study has uncovered an important clue to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection and illustrates the havoc that a small ORF can cause in cells.",PMC4179872,10.4049/jimmunol.1303196,outbreak,SARS Coronavirus,16287687,,

An invasive syndrome involving abscess formation has emerged in recent years. Putative virulence factors associated with this syndrome include colony hypermucoviscosity, and magA and rmpA genes. We studied epidemiologic and microbiologic characteristics of K. pneumoniae bacteraemia at two South Australian hospitals and identified cases of K. pneumoniae invasive syndrome. We determined the frequency of the hypermucoviscosity, magA and rmpA genes among bacteraemic and selected non-bacteraemic isolates.METHODS: Thirty-one patients with K. pneumoniae bacteraemia treated between June 2010 and July 2011 were included. Existing records were examined for relevant clinical and microbiological data. Urinary and wound isolates were also examined. Hypermucoviscosity was identified by a positive string test, whilst polymerase chain reaction detected magA and rmpA positive isolates.RESULTS: Of 31 blood culture isolates, 22 were associated with community-acquired infection. Biliary infection was the commonest source, occurring in ten patients. Three patients had K. pneumoniae invasive syndrome, all of Asian extraction (p = 0.0044). Four blood isolates demonstrated one or more of hypermucoviscosity, magA or rmpA; three were from patients with liver abscesses. Liver abscess isolates were all K1 serotype and had similar PFGE profiles.CONCLUSIONS: This study augments understanding of local epidemiology and microbiology of K. pneumoniae bacteraemia.

In infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, such persisters underlie the need for long-term antibiotic therapy and contribute to treatment failure in tuberculosis cases. Here, we demonstrate the value of dual-reporter mycobacteriophages (Î_(2)DRMs) for characterizing M. tuberculosis persisters. The addition of isoniazid (INH) to exponentially growing M. tuberculosis cells consistently resulted in a 2- to 3-log decrease in CFU within 4Â days, and the remaining â‰_1% of cells, which survived despite being INH sensitive, were INH-tolerant persisters with a distinct transcriptional profile. We fused the promoters of several genes upregulated in persisters to the red fluorescent protein tdTomato gene in Î_(2)GFP10, a mycobacteriophage constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), thus generating Î_(2)DRMs. A population enriched in INH persisters exhibited strong red fluorescence, by microscopy and flow cytometry, using a Î_(2)DRM with tdTomato controlled from the dnaK promoter. Interestingly, we demonstrated that, prior to INH exposure, a population primed for persistence existed in M. tuberculosis cells from both cultures and human sputa and that this population was highly enriched following INH exposure. We conclude that Î_(2)DRMs provide a new tool to identify and quantitate M. tuberculosis persister cells.IMPORTANCE: Tuberculosis (TB) is again the leading cause of death from a single infectious disease, having surpassed HIV. The recalcitrance of the TB pandemic is largely due to the ability of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis to enter a persistent state in which it is less susceptible to antibiotics and immune effectors, necessitating lengthy treatment. It has been difficult to study persister cells, as we have lacked tools to isolate these rare cells. In this article, we describe the development of dual-reporter mycobacteriophages that encode a green fluorescent marker of viability and in which the promoters of genes we have identified as induced in the persister state are fused to a gene encoding a red fluorescent protein. We show that these tools can identify heterogeneity in a cell population that correlates with propensity to survive antibiotic treatment and that the proportions of these subpopulations change in M. tuberculosis cells within human sputum during the course of treatment.",PMC5080378,10.1128/mBio.01023-16,clinical;treatment,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,16471224,,

The single clones of the strains with mixed infections were separated by subculturing them on the LÃ¶wenstein-Jensen medium.RESULTS: Of these 384 isolates, twelve strains (3.13%) were identified as mixed infections by MIRU-VNTR. Statistical analysis indicated that demographic characteristics and drug susceptibility profiles showed no statistically significant association with the mixed infections. We further subcultured the mixed infection strains and selected 30 clones from the subculture for each mixed infection. Genotyping data revealed that eight (8/12, 66.7%) strains with mixed infections had converted into single infection through subculture. The higher growth rate was associated with the increasing proportion of variant subpopulation through subculture.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, by using the MIRU-VNTR method, we demonstrate that the prevalence of mixed infections in Inner Mongolia is low. Additionally, our findings reveal that the subculture changes the population structures of mixed infections, and the subpopulation with higher growth rate show better fitness, which is associated with high proportion among the population structure after subculture.

However, there has been little work on how HPV integration status relates to treatment outcome for cervical carcinomas. In the current study, HPV E2 and E6 gene copy numbers were measured in 111 cervical cancer tissues using real-time QPCR. Integration patterns were divided into four groups: single copy-integrated with episomal components (group 1), single copy-integrated without episomal components (group 2), multicopy tandem repetition-integrated (group 3), and low HPV (group 4) groups. A relapse-predicting model was constructed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards model to classify patients into different risk groups for disease-free survival (DFS). The model was internally validated using bootstrap resampling. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed to evaluate gene expression patterns in relation to the different integration groups. DFS rate was inferior in the order of the patients in group 4, group 2/3, and group 1. Multivariate analysis showed that histologic grade, clinical stage group, and integration pattern were significant prognostic factors for poor DFS.

Although an extended HBV immunization program is being carried out since the early '80s, representing effective preventive measure, leading to a dramatic reduction of HBV hepatitis incidence, globally HBV infection still represents a major public health problem. The HBV virus is a DNA virus belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family. The HBV-DNA is a circular, partial double strand genome. All coding information is on the minus DNA strand and it is organized into four open reading frames. Despite hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus, it has a high mutation rate due to its replicative strategy, that leads to the production of many non-identical variants at each cycle of replication. In fact, it contains a polymerase without the proofreading activity, and uses an RNA intermediate (pgRNA) during its replication, so error frequencies are comparable to those seen in retroviruses and other RNA viruses rather than in more stable DNA viruses. Due to the low fidelity of the polymerase, the high replication rate and the overlapping reading frames, mutations occur throughout the genome and they have been identified both in the structural and not structural gene. The arise of mutations being to develop of a whole of viral variants called &quot;quasi-species&quot; and the prevalent population, which favors virus replication, was selected by viral fitness, host's immune pressure and external pressure, i.e., vaccination or antiviral therapy.

HIV-1 and HIV-2 (human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2), which have collectively caused over 35 million deaths, are the result of multiple CSTs from chimpanzees, gorillas, and sooty mangabeys. While the immediate history of HIV is known, there are over 45 lentiviruses that infect specific species of primates, and patterns of host switching are not well characterized. We thus took a phylogenetic approach to better understand the natural history of SIV recombination and CST. We modeled host species as a discrete character trait on the viral phylogeny and inferred historical host switches and the pairwise transmission rates between each pair of 24 primate hosts. We identify 14 novel, well-supported, ancient cross-species transmission events. We also find that lentiviral lineages vary widely in their ability to infect new host species: SIVcol (from colobus monkeys) is evolutionarily isolated, while SIVagms (from African green monkeys) frequently move between host subspecies. We also examine the origins of SIVcpz (the predecessor of HIV-1) in greater detail than previous studies, and find that there are still large portions of the genome with unknown origins. Observed patterns of CST are likely driven by a combination of ecological circumstance and innate immune factors.",NA,NA,transmission,Human Immunodeficy Virus,16842218,,

Whole genome sequencing was used to compare E. coli O157 isolates from host reservoirs (cattle and sheep) from Scotland and to compare genetic variation of isolates (human, animal, environmental/food) obtained from Scotland, New Zealand, Netherlands, Canada and the USA. Nei's genetic distance calculated from core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) demonstrated that the animal isolates were from the same population. Investigation of the Shiga toxin bacteriophage and their insertion sites (SBI typing) revealed that cattle and sheep isolates had statistically indistinguishable rarefaction profiles, diversity and genotypes. In contrast, isolates from different countries exhibited significant differences in Nei's genetic distance and SBI typing. Hence, after successful international transmission, which has occurred on multiple occasions, local genetic variation occurs, resulting in a global patchwork of continental and trans-continental phylogeographic clades. These findings are important for three reasons: first, understanding transmission and evolution of infectious diseases associated with multiple host reservoirs and multi-geographic locations; second, highlighting the relevance of the sheep reservoir when considering farm based interventions; and third, improving our understanding of why human disease incidence varies across the world.",PMC4595763,10.1038/srep14145,geography;genome;mBio;clinical,Escherichia coli,17148079,,

Whole-genome sequence data of 200 CC95 strains from various origins enabled determination of the CC95 pangenome. The pangenome analysis revealed that strains of the complex could be assigned to one of five subgroups that vary in their serotype, extraintestinal virulence, virulence gene content, and antibiotic resistance gene profile. A total of 511 CC95 strains isolated from humans living in France, Australia, and the United States were screened for their subgroup membership using a PCR-based method. The CC95 subgroups are nonrandomly distributed with respect to their geographic origin. The relative frequency of the subgroups was shown to change through time, although the nature of the changes varies with continent. Strains of the subgroups are also nonrandomly distributed with respect to source of isolation (blood, urine, or feces) and host sex. Collectively, the evidence indicates that although strains belonging to CC95 may be cosmopolitan, human movement patterns have been insufficient to homogenize the distribution of the CC95 subgroups. Rather, the manner in which CC95 strains evolve appears to vary both spatially and temporally. Although CC95 strains appeared globally as pandemic, fine-scale structure analysis shows epidemic patterns of the CC95 subgroups. Furthermore, the observation that the relative frequency of CC95 subgroups at a single locality has changed over time indicates that the relative fitness of the subgroups has changed. IMPORTANCEEscherichia coli clonal complex 95 represents a cosmopolitan, genetically diverse lineage, and the extensive substructure observed in this lineage is epidemiologically and clinically relevant. The frequency with which CC95 strains are responsible for extraintestinal infection appears to have been stable over the past 15Â years. However, the different subgroups identified within this lineage have an epidemic structure depending on the host, sample, continent, and time. Thus, the evolution and spread of strains belonging to CC95 are very different from those of another cosmopolitan human-associated clonal complex, CC131, which has increased significantly in frequency as a cause of extraintestinal infection over the past 15 years due to the evolution and spread of two very closely related, nearly monomorphic lineages.",NA,NA,genome;diversity;drug resistance;geography;phylogeny;mBio,Escherichia coli,17148079,,

Genotype D is one of eight currently recognized major HBV genotypes. The virus is ubiquitous worldwide, but shows different features in different regions. One hundred and ninety-eight patients with chronic HBV infection were enrolled in this study, 38 of whom had been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV DNA was isolated from the patients' blood samples and the entire genome and/or the basal core promoter/core promoter region sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes revealed that subgenotype D1 is the most prevalent subgenotype in Turkey, but there was no definite phylogenetic grouping according to geography for isolates from different regions within Turkey, or for isolates in Turkey relative to other parts of the world. Turkish isolates tended to be genetically similar to European and central Asian isolates. Overall, HBV-infection in Turkey appears to be characterized by early HBeAg seroconversion, a high incidence of the A1896 core promoter mutation and a small viral load. Genotype D characteristic mutations A1757 and T1764/G1766 were found in the BCP region. T1773 was associated with T1764/G1766 and a larger viral load.

Around 400 million people worldwide carrier of HBV of which more than 250 million reside in Asia, and 1-2Â million people have died from it. It has a partially double-stranded DNA, having 3.2-kb genome size and replicate via reverse transcription of RNA intermediate. In the natural history or during the antiviral therapy of chronic HBV infection, seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBeAg is usually accompanied by a decrease in viral replication and remission of liver disease. Based on genomic sequence data HBV is classified into eight genotypes A-H and four major serotypes ayw, ayr, adw and adr on the basis of complete genome and S gene sequence analysis. Genotypes and serotypes are useful tools in understanding the epidemiology of HBV infection. HBV genotypes have distinct geographical distributions. The HBV variants appear during HBeAg seroconversion and they bring mutations in the precore region (PC) that prevent HBeAg synthesis. Another common HBeAg variant is the basal core promoter mutant (BCP) characterized by point mutation in the promoter of both HBeAg mRNA and core protein mRNA. The most frequent core promoter mutation is the double A1762T and G1764A nucleotide exchange, which results in a substantial decrease in HBeAg expression but enhanced viral genome replication. The approved antiviral drugs such as Interferon, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir and telbivudine for purpose of treating chronic HBV infection is to prevent or stop the progression of liver injury by suppressing viral replication or eliminating infection.

HBV genotypes have a distinct geographical distribution. As chronic HBV infection is endemic in the Asian region, genotypes B and C prevail there, and genotypes A and D are mainly found in the western world and Europe. Genotypes A, B, C, and D have been studied most extensively. In Europe and Asia, most patients with genotypes A and B have acute hepatitis B; however, some mutants may tend to cause fulminant hepatitis B. Many studies have indicated that the severity and outcomes of chronic hepatitis B infections are more serious in patients with genotypes C and D than in those with genotypes A and B. Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are more frequently diagnosed in carriers of genotypes C and D than in those of genotypes A and B. Accumulating evidence indicated that higher plasma HBV DNA levels, infection with HBV genotype C, as well as mutations at 1653T, 1753V, and A1762T/G1764A are independently associated with the risk of HCC in Asian men. However, the therapeutic responses differ with regard to the different HBV genotypes. For example, the response to interferon-Î± treatment in patients with genotypes A and B was better than that in patients with genotypes C, D, and mixed genotypes. Some studies have shown seroconversion after treatment, i.e., genotypes A and C may switch to genotypes D and B, respectively. Some reports indicated a correlation between the emergence of the hepatitis B e antigen-negative variant in patients with genotypes C and D and worsening of liver injury without sustained response. In order to provide better treatment options for these poorly responding patients, further studies, e.g, novel immunomodulatory therapies, are required.

This virus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV was linked to a zoonotic origin from rhinolophid bats in 2005. Since then, numerous studies have described novel bat CoVs, including close relatives of the newly emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. In this paper we discuss CoV genomic properties and compare different taxonomic approaches in light of the technical difficulties of obtaining full genomic sequences directly from bat specimens. We first present an overview of the available studies on bat CoVs, with details on their chiropteran hosts, then comparatively analyze the increase in bat CoV studies and novel genomic sequences obtained since the SARS pandemic. We then conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus, to show that bats harbour more CoV diversity than other mammalian hosts and are widely represented in most, but not all parts of the tree of mammalian CoVs. We next discuss preliminary evidence for phylogenetic co-segregation of CoVs and bat hosts encompassing the Betacoronavirus clades b and d, with an emphasis on the sampling bias that exists among bat species and other mammals, then present examples of CoVs infecting different hosts on the one hand and viruses apparently confined to host genera on the other. We also demonstrate a geographic bias within available studies on bat CoVs, and identify a critical lack of information from biodiversity hotspots in Africa, Asia and Latin America. We then present evidence for a zoonotic origin of four of the six known human CoVs (HCoV), three of which likely involved bats, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E; compare the available data on CoV pathogenesis in bats to that in other mammalian hosts; and discuss hypotheses on the putative insect origins of CoV ancestors. Finally, we suggest caution with conclusions on the zoonotic potential of bat viruses, based only on genomic sequence data, and emphasize the need to preserve these ecologically highly relevant animals.

Cervical tissues consisting of no cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (84 cases), grade I cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (176 cases), grade II-III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (91 cases), and squamous cell carcinoma (66 cases) were subjected for HPV genotyping by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse line blot hybridization assay and for HPV genome status determination by amplification of papillomavirus oncogene transcripts (APOT) assay. HPV prevalence was 28.6% in no cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 40.3% in grade I cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 70.3% in grade II-III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 86.4% in squamous cell carcinoma cases. The three most common HR-HPV types were HPV 16, 58, and 18 which were distributed in all cervical lesions. HPV physical statuses could be investigated in 4 no cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, 2 grade I cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, 28 grade II-III cervical intraepithelial neoplasias and 31 squamous cell carcinomas. The integrated-derived transcripts were found 3.6% in grade II-III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 48.4% in squamous cell carcinoma, whereas no viral genome integration was found in the group of no cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or grade I cervical intraepithelial neoplasia samples. The frequencies of HR-HPV integration in squamous cell carcinoma were found 40%, 100%, 20% of HPV 16, 18, and 58.

Seven out of 100 samples were excluded due to low quality of extracted DNA from paraffin-embedded specimens. Thus, 93 samples were included for HPV genotyping.RESULT: All samples were examined using SPF10 primers for HPV detection. HPV DNA was positive in 8 out of 93 (8.6%) ESCC specimens. Using INNO-LiPA genotyping system we detected the genotypes of 5 out of 8 HPV-positive samples. Both HPV types 16 and 6 were detected in 3 specimens; one sample was positive for HPV type 18 and 2 samples were co-infected with two HPV types. There were no statistically significant differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases with regard to clinical and pathologic findings. Three samples were positive for SPF10 indicating HPV infection; however, the exact HPV type could not be clarified using INNO-LiPA genotyping .CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present study showed that a small proportion of ESCC specimens from Iran harbor HPV16, 18 genome using a highly sensitive method. As different rates have been reported from Iran, a more widespread study with more precise definition of geographical differences could delineate the potential involvement of HPV in the development of ESCC in Iranian population.",NA,NA,genotype;clinical;diagnosis;cancer;characterization,Human Papillomavirus,17682708,,

The presence of viral RNA in human and swine samples was also evaluated, and phylogenetic analysis was performed on HEV-positive samples. Forty-two swine farms were sampled; 142 workers were enrolled in the study and classified into two groups: (i) 69 workers with occupational contact with swine (including veterinarians and farmers) recruited in the 42 sampled farms; (ii) 73 without occupational contact with swine. Forty-one of 42 (97%) swine farms resulted positive to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test for HEV antibodies (Abs). Overall seroprevalence in swine was 50% (441/879), with seropositivity rate higher in sows (333/469, 71%). HEV RNA in stool samples was detected in animals from 13 of 42 tested farms (31%), and a higher positivity resulted in weaners (40/246, 16.3%). Phylogenetic analysis classified all HEV isolates within genotype 3 (subtypes 3f, 3e, 3c). All humans were negative for HEV viral genome in blood. Five of 142 sera were positive for IgG anti-HEV with an overall prevalence of 3.52% with no statistically significant differences in prevalence rates between workers at zoonotic risk and the control group (5.7% versus 1.3%). In contrast, a significant difference (OR 10.1) was observed within the subgroup including subjects exposed for short periods (veterinarians) compared with those who worked for long periods (farmers) suggesting a correlation between the time of exposure and the likelihood of HEV infection. Reporting HEV infection is not mandatory in Italy, but a constant epidemiological surveillance should be ensured to clarify the epidemiology of this disease.",NA,NA,clinical;diagnosis;genome;phylogeny,Hepatitis E,17706898,,

Among 144 serum samples of wild boars captured in Mie prefecture, 7 were positive for HEV-RNA. The nucleotide sequence of nearly the entire genome was determined for 4 of the 7 positive samples. Phylogenetic tree analyses indicated that 6 samples were subtype 3e and 1 was subtype 3a among the 7 isolates. We identified the indigenization of subtype 3e isolates in Japanese wild boars. Furthermore, 5 subtype 3e isolates were closely related and were located in the peripheral branch of subtype 3e isolates from European countries in the phylogenetic tree. The structure indicated that the ancestor of the 5 subtype 3e isolates originated in Europe. The phylogenetic structure and coalescent analyses suggested that the subtype 3e isolates entered Japan from Europe by importation of large-race pigs around 1966. The results also indicated that several lineages of subtype 3e expanded to a wide area of Japan around 1992 and 1 of the lineages was indigenized in wild boars in Mie prefecture between 1992 and 2009. The appearance of a wild boar cluster in the peripheral branch in the phylogenetic lineage may indicate the direction of gene flow of HEV subtype 3e from swine to wild boars.

The genetic shift that gave rise to the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic originated from a triple gene reassortment of avian, swine and human IFVs. More minor genetic alterations in genetic drift can lead to influenza drug resistance such as the H274Y mutation associated with oseltamivir resistance. Hence, a rapid tool to detect IFV mutations and the potential emergence of new virulent strains can better prepare us for seasonal influenza outbreaks as well as potential pandemics. Furthermore, identification of specific mutations by closely examining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IFV sequences is essential to classify potential genetic markers associated with potentially dangerous IFV phenotypes. In this study, we developed a novel R library called &quot;SNPer&quot; to analyze quantitative variants in SNPs among IFV subpopulations. The computational SNPer program was applied to three different subpopulations of published IFV genomic information. SNPer queried SNPs data and grouped the SNPs into (1) universal SNPs, (2) likely common SNPs, and (3) unique SNPs. SNPer outperformed manual visualization in terms of time and labor. SNPer took only three seconds with no errors in SNP comparison events compared with 40 hours with errors using manual visualization. The SNPer tool can accelerate the capacity to capture new and potentially dangerous IFV strains to mitigate future influenza outbreaks.",PMC4395159,10.1371/journal.pone.0122812,drug resistance;outbreak,Haemophilus Influenza,17997603,,

However, the diverse HLA alleles among humans complicate virus-specific cellular immunity research, and elucidation of cross-HLA allele T cell responses to influenza virus specificity requires further detailed work. An ideal CTL epitope-based vaccine would cover a broad spectrum of epitope antigens presented by most, if not all, of the HLAs. Here, we evaluated the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus-specific T cell responses among the HLA-A24(+) population using a rationally designed peptide pool during the 2009 pandemic. Unexpectedly, cross-HLA allele T cell responses against the influenza A virus peptides were detected among both HLA-A11(+) and HLA-A24(+) donors. Furthermore, we found cross-responses in the entire HLA-A3 supertype population (including HLA-A11, -A31, -A33, and -A30). The cross-allele antigenic peptides within the peptide pool were identified and characterized, and the crystal structures of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complexes were determined. The subsequent HLA-A24-defined cross-allele peptides recognized by the HLA-A11(+) population were shown to mildly bind to the HLA-A*1101 molecule. Together with the structural models, these results partially explain the cross-allele responses.

The fosfomycin MICs were determined by the agar dilution method according to CLSI guidelines. PCR was used to detect the plasmid-encoded fosfomycin resistance genes (fosA, fosA3, fosB and fosC2). For isolates harbouring plasmid-encoded fosfomycin resistance genes, sequence types (STs) were determined. The transformation experiment was performed using E. coli TOPO10 (Invitrogen, USA) as a recipient strain.

Although there was no apparent clonal relationship found between clinical strains and those from seafood-related sources positive with pathogenic markers, there were clonal relationships between clinical strains from this study and those from environmental sources in other parts of China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that strains of 112 STs (61 STs from this study and 51 retrieved from PUBMLST database covering different continents) could be divided into four branches. The vast majority of our isolates and those from other countries were genetically diverse and clustered into two major branches of mixed distribution (of geographic origins and sample sources), whereas five STs representing six isolates split as two minor branches because of divergence of their recA genes, which had 80%-82% nucleotide identity to typical V. parahaemolyticus strains and 73.3%-76.9% identity to the CDS24 of a Vibrio sp. plasmid p23023, indicating that the recA gene might have recombined by lateral gene transfer.

This reservoir presents a major barrier to the cure of HIV-1 infection. To purge the reservoir, pharmacological reactivation of latent HIV-1 has been proposed and tested both in vitro and in vivo. A key remaining question is whether virus-specific immune mechanisms, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), can clear infected cells in ART-treated patients after latency is reversed. Here we show that there is a striking all or none pattern for CTL escape mutations in HIV-1 Gag epitopes. Unless ART is started early, the vast majority (&gt;98%) of latent viruses carry CTL escape mutations that render infected cells insensitive to CTLs directed at common epitopes. To solve this problem, we identified CTLs that could recognize epitopes from latent HIV-1 that were unmutated in every chronically infected patient tested. Upon stimulation, these CTLs eliminated target cells infected with autologous virus derived from the latent reservoir, both in vitro and in patient-derived humanized mice. The predominance of CTL-resistant viruses in the latent reservoir poses a major challenge to viral eradication.

Clinical and postmortem examination revealed no signs of disease, including liver damage. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR from different organs and tissues, together with the presence of an miR-122 binding site in the viral genome, strongly suggests a liver tropism for bovine hepacivirus, making this novel virus a promising animal model for HCV infections in humans.IMPORTANCE: Livestock animals act as important sources for emerging pathogens. In particular, their large herd size and the existence of multiple ways of direct and food-borne infection routes emphasize their role as virus reservoirs. Apart from the search for novel viruses, detailed characterization of these pathogens is indispensable in the context of risk analysis. Here, we describe the identification of a novel HCV-like virus in cattle. In addition, determination of the prevalence and of the course of infection in cattle herds provides valuable insights into the biology of this novel virus. The results presented here form a basis for future studies targeting viral pathogenesis of bovine hepaciviruses and their potential to establish zoonotic infections.",PMC4473572,10.1128/JVI.00534-15,genome;mBio;phylogeny,Hepatitis C,18297707,,

The prevalence and pathogenic effects of these hepatitis virus infections, in particular HGV, on clinical outcome and the need for surveillance are controversial. The present study examined the prevalence of HCV and HGV infections using polymerase chain reaction-based molecular methods in Iranian patients who had undergone orthotopic liver transplantation (oLT).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2010, 202 EDTA-treated blood samples were obtained before and after liver transplantation in 106 patients. An optimized qualitative in-house multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction protocol was used for simultaneous diagnosis of HCV and HGV infections.RESULTS: Hepatitis C virus molecular infection was diagnosed in 13 of 202 plasma samples (6.4%) in 10 of 106 patients (9.4%) before and after oLT. Eleven of 202 plasma samples (5.4%) from 10 of 106 patients (9.4%) demonstrated HGV genome infection before and after oLT.CONCLUSION: Detection of moderate prevalence of HCV and especially HGV infection in liver transplant recipients suggests potential importance of HCV infection in liver dysfunction and supports the hypothesis that HGV infection has a pathogenic role in liver-related clinical complications.",NA,NA,mBio;clinical;outcome,Hepatitis C,18297707,,

We thus conducted this prospective study to analyze the molecular epidemiology of K. pneumoniae isolates from patients being treated in the 306 Hospital in Beijing, China for the period of November 1, 2010-October 31, 2011.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Antibiotic susceptibility testing, PCR amplification and sequencing of the drug resistance-associated genes, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were conducted. A total of 163 isolates were analyzed. The percentage of MDR, XDR and PDR isolates were 63.8% (104), 20.9 (34), and 1.8% (3), respectively. MLST results showed that 60 sequence types (STs) were identified, which were further separated by eBURST into 13 clonal complexes and 18 singletons. The most dominant ST was ST15 (10.4%). Seven new alleles and 24 new STs were first identified in this study. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that certain clinical characteristics were associated with those prevalent STs such as: from ICU, from medical ward, from community acquired infection, from patients without heart disease, from patients with treatment success, susceptible to extended spectrum cephalosporin, susceptible to cephamycins, susceptible to fluoroquinolones, and with MDR.SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate that certain drug-resistant K. pneumoniae clones are highly prevalent and are associated with certain clinical characteristics in hospital settings.

This diverse collection of organisms with various resistance mechanisms is associated with increased lengths of hospitalization, costs of care, morbidity, and mortality. The global spread of CRE has largely been attributed to dissemination of a dominant strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing a serine Î_-lactamase, termed K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Here we report an outbreak of KPC-producing CRE infections in which the degree of horizontal transmission between strains and species of a promiscuous plasmid is unprecedented. Sixteen isolates, comprising 11 unique strains, 6 species, and 4 genera of bacteria, were obtained from 14 patients over the first 8 months of the outbreak. Of the 11 unique strains, 9 harbored the same highly promiscuous plasmid carrying the KPC gene bla(KPC). The remaining strains harbored distinct bla(KPC) plasmids, one of which was carried in a strain of Klebsiella oxytoca coisolated from the index patient and the other generated from transposition of the bla(KPC) element Tn4401. All isolates could be genetically traced to the index patient. Molecular epidemiological investigation of the outbreak was aided by the adaptation of nested arbitrary PCR (ARB-PCR) for rapid plasmid identification. This detailed molecular genetic analysis, combined with traditional epidemiological investigation, provides insights into the highly fluid dynamics of drug resistance transmission during the outbreak. IMPORTANCE The ease of horizontal transmission of carbapenemase resistance plasmids across strains, species, and genera of bacteria observed in this study has several important public health and epidemiological implications. First, it has the potential to promote dissemination of carbapenem resistance to new populations of Enterobacteriaceae, including organisms of low virulence, leading to the establishment of reservoirs of carbapenem resistance genes in patients and/or the environment and of high virulence, raising the specter of untreatable community-associated infections. Second, recognition of plasmid-mediated outbreaks, such as those described here, is problematic because analysis of resistance plasmids from clinical isolates is laborious and technically challenging. Adaptation of nested arbitrary PCR (ARB-PCR) to investigate the plasmid outbreak facilitated our investigation, and the method may be broadly applicable to other outbreaks due to other conserved mobile genetic elements. Whether infection control measures that focus on preventing transmission of drug-resistant clones are effective in controlling dissemination of these elements is unknown.",PMC3202755,10.1128/mBio.00204-11,drug resistance;mBio;control,Klebsiella pneumonia,18426899,,

This study aimed to determine the molecular epidemiology of their spread in two Asian countries with contrasting prevalence. We conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of ESBL-E. coli ST131 strains collected prospectively from Nepal and Japan, two countries in Asia with a high and low prevalence of ESBL-E. coli, respectively. We also systematically compared these genomes with those reported from other regions using publicly available WGS data for E.Â coli ST131 strains. Further, we conducted phylogenetic analysis of these isolates and all genome sequence data for ST131 strains to determine sequence diversity. One hundred five unique ESBL-E. coli isolates from Nepal (February 2013 to July 2013) and 76 isolates from Japan (October 2013 to September 2014) were included. Of these isolates, 54 (51%) isolates from Nepal and 11 (14%) isolates from Japan were identified as ST131 by WGS. Phylogenetic analysis based on WGS suggested that the majority of ESBL-E. coli ST131 isolates from Nepal clustered together, whereas those from Japan were more diverse. Half of the ESBL-E. coli ST131 isolates from Japan belonged to virotype C, whereas half of the isolates from Nepal belonged to a virotype other than virotype A, B, C, D, or E (A/B/C/D/E). The dominant sublineage of E.Â coli ST131 was H30Rx, which was most prominent in ESBL-E. coli ST131 isolates from Nepal. Our results revealed distinct phylogenetic characteristics of ESBL-E. coli ST131 spread in the two geographical areas of Asia, indicating the involvement of multiple factors in its local spread in each region. IMPORTANCE The global spread of ESBL-E. coli has been driven in large part by pandemic sequence type 131 (ST131). A recent study suggested that, within E.Â coli ST131, certain sublineages have disseminated worldwide with little association with their geographical origin, highlighting the complexity of the epidemiology of this pandemic clone. ST131 bacteria have also been classified into four virotypes based on the distribution of certain virulence genes. Information on virotype distribution in Asian ST131 strains is limited. We conducted whole-genome sequencing of ESBL-E. coli ST131 strains collected in Nepal and Japan, two Asian countries with a high and low prevalence of ESBL-E. coli, respectively. We systematically compared these ST131 genomes with those reported from other regions to gain insights into the molecular epidemiology of their spread and found the distinct phylogenetic characteristics of the spread of ESBL-E. coli ST131 in these two geographical areas of Asia.",PMC5082631,10.1128/mSphere.00289-16,genome;phylogeny;drug resistance,Escherichia coli,18446190,,

Classical approaches have shown that S. sonnei is genetically conserved and clonal(7). We report here whole-genome sequencing of 132 globally distributed isolates. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the current S. sonnei population descends from a common ancestor that existed less than 500 years ago and that diversified into several distinct lineages with unique characteristics. Our analysis suggests that the majority of this diversification occurred in Europe and was followed by more recent establishment of local pathogen populations on other continents, predominantly due to the pandemic spread of a single, rapidly evolving, multidrug-resistant lineage.",PMC3442231,10.1038/ng.2369,phylogeny;genome,Escherichia coli,18446190,,

Different genetic clades have been identified and defined based on amino acid substitutions found in the haemagglutinin (HA) protein sequences. In Spain, circulating influenza viruses are monitored each season by the regional laboratories enrolled in the Spanish Influenza Surveillance System (SISS). The analysis of the HA gene sequence helps to detect the genetic diversity and viral evolution.OBJECTIVES: To perform an analysis of the genetic diversity of influenza A(H1N1)2009 viruses circulating in Spain during the season 2010-2011 based on analysis of the HA sequence gene.STUDY DESIGN: Phylogenetic analysis based on the HA1 subunit of the haemagglutinin gene was carried out on 220 influenza A(H1N1)2009 viruses circulating during the season 2010-2011.RESULTS: Six different genetic groups were identified among circulating A(H1N1)2009 viruses, five of them were previously reported during season 2010-2011. A new group, characterized by E172K and K308E changes and a proline at position 83, was observed in 12.27% of the Spanish viruses.CONCLUSION: Co-circulation of six different genetic groups of influenza A(H1N1)2009 viruses was identified in Spain during the season 2010-2011.

These viruses evolves constantly due to two main characteristics: the first one is the lack of the correction ability of the viral polymerase which causes the accumulation of single nucleotide mutations in the viral genes introduced by an error-prone viral RNA polymerase, (antigenic shift). The second one is the nature of their genome, formed by eight segments, which allows the interchange of genes between two different viral strains (antigenic drift). This viral plasticity, has allowed to the influenza A viruses to infect new host species and to cause infections with a pandemic characteristics. The Spanish influenza surveillance system, SVGE (its Spanish acronym), arises as a response to the possibility of facing a pandemic situation, especially after the transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans. This surveillance system is formed by sixteen physician and paediatrics network, nineteen epidemiological services coordinated by the National Epidemiological Centre (CNE) and eighteen laboratories , the Spanish Laboratories of Influenza network (ReLEG), coordinated by the National Centre of Microbiology. The aim of this article is to show the action of the ReLEG, in the pandemic caused by the influenza virus A(H1N1) during the season 2009-2010.

Putative recombinants were examined using bootscan analysis. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the nucleotide sequence alignments of the entire genes of amplified glycoproteins gI and gG suggested that three distinct HSV-1 genogroups were circulating in the Irish population. At least 15 HSV-1 intergenic recombinants with a recombination point between gI and gG, and 11 HSV-1 intragenic recombinants were detected. There was no evident association between genetic group and gender, disease recurrence or anatomical site of infection. Genital isolates (nâ€‰=â€‰30) belonged to all genogroups.

Heterogeneity in latently infected cell populations and homoeostatic proliferation of infected cells might affect the dynamics of virus production and persistence. Despite potent antiretroviral therapy, chronic immune activation, inflammation, and immune dysfunction persist, and are likely to have important effects on the size and distribution of the viral reservoir. The inability of the immune system to recognise cells harbouring latent virus and to eliminate cells actively producing virus is the biggest challenge to finding a cure.

HBV infection can lead to variable clinical outcomes, ranging from self-limiting acute hepatitis to active chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study characterizes HBV strains circulating among patients with acute (AHB) and chronic HBV infection (CHB). Among a total of 653 HBsAg positive cases, 40 manifested acute infection. After sequencing the surface(S), basal core promoter/pre-core(BCP/PC) and the X gene regions, phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA4 by neighbor-joining method. Statistical robustness was established with bootstrap analysis. Nucleotide diversity was determined by Shannon entropy per site using the Entropy program of the Los Alamos National Laboratories. Analyses of acute patients revealed that HBV/D2 is the major circulating sub-genotype and commonly associated with sexual promiscuity and the age group between15-30 years. Comparison of AHB and CHB patients revealed that HBeAg positivity, ALT levels and genotype D were significantly high in AHB, whereas CHB patients were predominantly male, had a high viral load, and were commonly associated with genotype C. The frequencies of mutations in the S, BCP/PC, and X gene were low in AHB as compared to CHB. Drug resistant mutations were not detectable in the polymerase gene of AHB. Average nucleotide diversity in AHB was considerably low as compared to CHB.

Eighty-one complete genomes from HBV isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The studied population was grouped into three categories including inactive carriers, patients with chronic hepatitis, and patients with liver cirrhosis. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Iranian patients were infected with HBV genotype D and subgenotype D1. The most common subtype was ayw2, followed by ayw3 and ayw4. Several deletions and insertions that had no correlation with disease outcome were observed in the HBV genomes. The most frequent mutation in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was sP120S. Almost half of the patients studied carried precore (PC) mutant variants and one-third of the studied population was infected with variants carrying basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. PC and BCP mutations were observed in older patients, especially in those with chronic liver disease. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were HBeAg negative, and the prevalence of precore mutant isolates (G1896A) was higher in this group than in HBeAg-positive patients. Lamivudine drug resistance mutations were detected after 1 year of treatment in about 30% of lamivudine-treated patients. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HBV subgenotype D1 is the only subgenotype circulating in Iran, and there is no evidence of any exotic genotype in the region. The HBV PC (G1896A) mutation may play an important role in the clinical outcome of the disease by increasing the risk of progressive liver disease among Iranian patients infected with HBV.",NA,NA,clinical;outcome;genotype;drug resistance;genome;mBio;phylogeny,Hepatitis B,19208347,,

In addition to the veterinary concerns regarding the H9N2 subtype, it is also considered to be the next potential human pandemic strain due to its rapid evolution and interspecies transmission. In this study, we utilize serial lung-to-lung passage of a low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAI) H9N2 (A/Ck/Korea/163/04, WT163) (Y439-lineage) in mice to increase pathogenicity and investigate the potential virulence marker. Mouse-adapted H9N2 virus obtained high virulence (100% mortality) in mice after 98 serial passages. Sequence results show that the mouse adaptation (ma163) possesses several mutations within seven gene segments (PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS) relative to the wild-type strain. The HA gene showed the most mutations (at least 11) with one resulting in the loss of an N-glycosylation site (at amino acid 166). Moreover, reverse genetic studies established that an E627K substitution in PB2 and the loss of the N-glycosylation site in the HA protein (aa166) are critical virulence markers in the mouse-adapted H9N2 virus. Thus, these results add to the increasing body of mutational analysis data defining the function of the viral polymerase and HA genes and their roles in mammalian host adaptation. To our knowledge, this is first report of the generation of a mammalian-adapted Korea H9N2 virus (Y493-lineages).

Panton Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is considered one of the important virulence factors of S. aureus responsible for destruction of white blood cells, necrosis and apoptosis and as a marker of community acquired MRSA. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of PVL genes among MRSA isolates and to check the reliability of PVL as marker of community acquired MRSA isolates from Western Nepal.METHODS: A total of 400 strains of S. aureus were collected from clinical specimens and various units (Operation Theater, Intensive Care Units) of the hospital and 139 of these had been confirmed as MRSA by previous study. Multiplex PCR was used to detect mecA and PVL genes. Clinical data as well as antimicrobial susceptibility data was analyzed and compared among PVL positive and negative MRSA isolates.RESULTS: Out of 139 MRSA isolates, 79 (56.8Â %) were PVL positive. The majority of the community acquired MRSA (90.4Â %) were PVL positive (Positive predictive value: 94.9Â % and negative predictive value: 86.6Â %), while PVL was detected only in 4 (7.1Â %) hospital associated MRSA strains. None of the MRSA isolates from hospital environment was found positive for the PVL genes. The majority of the PVL positive strains (75.5Â %) were isolated from pus samples. Antibiotic resistance among PVL negative MRSA isolates was found higher as compared to PVL positive MRSA.CONCLUSION: Our study showed high prevalence of PVL among community acquired MRSA isolates. Absence of PVL among MRSA isolates from hospital environment indicates its poor association with hospital acquired MRSA and therefore, PVL may be used a marker for community acquired MRSA. This is first study from Nepal, to test PVL among MRSA isolates from hospital environment.",PMC4867903,10.1186/s12879-016-1531-1,outbreak;hospital;drug resistance;community;clinical;diagnosis;mBio,Staphylococcus aureus,21395449,,

Currently, the majority of epidemic cholera reported globally is El Tor biotype Vibrio cholerae isolates of the serogroup O1. However, in Bangladesh, outbreaks attributed to V. cholerae serogroup O139 isolates, which fall within the same phylogenetic lineage as the O1 serogroup isolates, were seen between 1992 and 1993 and in 2002 to 2005. Since then, V. cholerae serogroup O139 has only been sporadically isolated in Bangladesh and is now rarely isolated elsewhere.METHODS: Here, we present case histories of four cholera patients infected with V. cholerae serogroup O139 in 2013 and 2014 in Bangladesh. We comprehensively typed these isolates using conventional approaches, as well as by whole genome sequencing. Phenotypic typing and PCR confirmed all four isolates belonging to the O139 serogroup.FINDINGS: Whole genome sequencing revealed that three of the isolates were phylogenetically closely related to previously sequenced El Tor biotype, pandemic 7, toxigenic V. cholerae O139 isolates originating from Bangladesh and elsewhere. The fourth isolate was a non-toxigenic V. cholerae that, by conventional approaches, typed as O139 serogroup but was genetically divergent from previously sequenced pandemic 7 V. cholerae lineages belonging to the O139 or O1 serogroups.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that previously observed lineages of V. cholerae O139 persist in Bangladesh and can cause clinical disease and that a novel disease-causing non-toxigenic O139 isolate also occurs.",PMC4642977,10.1371/journal.pntd.0004183,clinical;diagnosis;genome,Vibrio cholerae,21486909,,

Accordingly, public health implications of indigenous HEV infection have not been well addressed. The aim of this study was to clarify the route of transmission of a small outbreak of acute hepatitis E and assess the public health implications of indigenous zoonotic HEV transmission.METHODS: â€‚ Three patients with non-A, B and C acute hepatitis, two of whom presented in a critical condition, were assessed for HEV infection using polymerase chain reaction and their route of infection; the genome sequences of the infecting HEV were also analyzed. A phylogenetic tree based on the full, or near full, HEV RNA sequences were constructed by neighbor-joining method.RESULTS: â€‚ All three patients ingested grilled pork meat and entrails at the same barbecue restaurant in Abashiri, Hokkaido, Japan. When comparing partial to entire, or nearly entire, nucleotide sequences of HEV detected in these patients, they were 99.9-100% identical to each other. These genotype 4 isolates had great resemblance to the genome sequences of the isolates from the mini-outbreak in 2004 in Kitami, a city adjacent to Abashiri. These Kitami/Abashiri strains were segregated into a single cluster on the phylogenetic tree of HEV genotype 4 indigenous to Japan.CONCLUSION: â€‚ Indigenous HEV transmission via a zoonotic food-borne route has been demonstrated in Kitami and Abashiri via pork meat and entrails contaminated with virulent HEV strains.

HCV infection brings great threat to human health. Host genetic background could impact HCV infection, viral clearance, and treatment. Recently, some genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of HCV patients were performed. The results showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL28B gene, which encodes protein IFN-lambda3, are associated with viral clearance and treatment effectiveness of HCV patients who were cured by PEG-IFNalpha combined with ribavirin (RBV). IFN-lambda3 interacts with its acceptor, a heterodimer (IFN-lambdaR1 x IL-10R2), and upregulates the IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGF). IFN-lambda3 plays roles in antiviral, antitumor, and immunoloregulation, and thus it might become a potential drug for Hepatitis C treatment. However, the mechanism of the IL28B gene in HCV infection and treatment is unclear, and further studies are needed to reveal the veils and provide theoretical basis for developing a new antiviral drug in clinic.",NA,NA,genome;clinical;cancer,Hepatitis C,21606539,,

Pegylated interferon-Î± (PEG-IFN-Î±) in combination with ribavirin (RBV), the approved and standard therapy, leads to viral eradication in about 50% of treated patients. In 2009, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified host genetic variation to be critical for predicting treatment response and spontaneous clearance in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). A correlated set of polymorphisms in the region of the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) gene on chromosome 19, coding for interferon (IFN)-Î»3 were associated with clearance of genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) in patients treated with PEG-IFN-Î± and RBV. The same polymorphisms were subsequently associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV in untreated patients. In addition, prediction of viral response to PEG-IFN-Î± and RBV therapy of patients with recurrent HCV infection after orthotopic liver transplantation depends on the IL-28B genotype of both recipient and donor tissues. Diagnosis of a patient's IL-28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard-of-care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL-28B genotype. As GWAS yield unexpected data, this approach could lead to the development of novel drug therapy, such as already appears promising with IFN-Î».

A high through-put virulence genes microarray demonstrated Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPI) and adherence genes were highly conserved, while prophages and virulence plasmid genes were variably present. Isolates were grouped by serotype, and virulence plasmids separated S. Typhimurium in two clusters. Atypical microarray results lead to whole genome sequencing (WGS) of S.

Sal147 was unable to invade HeLa cells and showed reduced mortality in Galleria mellonella infection model, in comparison to a SPI-1 harbouring S. Infantis. Microarray and WGS of S. Typhimurium Sal199, established for the first time in S. Typhimurium presence of cdtB and other Typhi-related genes. Characterization of Sal199 showed cdtB genes were upstream of transposase IS911, and co-expressed with other Typhi-related genes. Cell cycle arrest, cytoplasmic distension, and nuclear enlargement were detected in HeLa cells infected by Sal199, but not with S. Typhimurium LT2. Increased mortality of Galleria was detected on infection with Sal199 compared to LT2. Thus, Salmonella isolates were rapidly characterized using a high through-put microarray; helping to identify unusual virulence features which were corroborated by further characterisation.

Typhimurium) is one of the most frequent causes of foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Between 2005-2008 a series of S. Typhimurium outbreaks occurred in Tasmania, Australia, that were all traced to eggs originating from a single chicken farm. We sequenced the genomes of 12 isolates linked to these outbreaks, in order to investigate the microevolution of a pathogenic S. Typhimurium clone in a natural, spatiotemporally restricted population.RESULTS: The isolates, which shared a phage type similar to DT135 known locally as 135@ or 135a, formed a clade within the S. Typhimurium population with close similarity to the reference genome SL1334 (160 single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs). Ten of the isolates belonged to a single clone (&lt;23 SNPs between isolate pairs) which likely represents the population of S. Typhimurium circulating at the chicken farm; the other two were from sporadic cases and were genetically distinct from this clone. Divergence dating indicated that all 12 isolates diverged from a common ancestor in the mid 1990 s, and the clone began to diversify in 2003-2004. This clone spilled out into the human population several times between 2005-2008, during which time it continued to accumulate SNPs at a constant rate of 3-5 SNPs per year or 1x10-6 substitutions site-1 year-1, faster than the longer-term (~50 year) rates estimated previously for S. Typhimurium. Our data suggest that roughly half of non-synonymous substitutions are rapidly removed from the S. Typhimurium population, after which purifying selection is no longer important and the remaining substitutions become fixed in the population. The S. Typhimurium 135@ isolates were nearly identical to SL1344 in terms of gene content and virulence plasmids. Their phage contents were close to SL1344, except that they carried a different variant of Gifsy-1, lacked the P2 remnant found in SL1344 and carried a novel P2 phage, P2-Hawk, in place SL1344's P2 phage SopEÏ•. DT135 lacks P2 prophage. Two additional plasmids were identified in the S. Typhimurium 135@ isolates, pSTM2 and pSTM7. Both plasmids were IncI1, but phylogenetic analysis of the plasmids and their bacterial hosts shows these plasmids are genetically distinct and result from independent plasmid acquisition events.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a high-resolution insight into short-term microevolution of the important human pathogen S. Typhimurium. It indicates that purifying selection occurs rapidly in this population (â‰_ 6 years) and then declines, and provides an estimate for the short-term substitution rate. The latter is likely to be more relevant for foodborne outbreak investigation than previous estimates based on longer time scales.",PMC3870983,10.1186/1471-2164-14-800,clinical;diagnosis;genome;mBio,Salmonella Enterica;Salmonella typhimurium,21722278,,

Here we report the use of next-generation sequencing technology to investigate the historical, geographic and genetic diversity of Bacillus anthracis in France. 122 strains isolated over a 60-years period throughout the country were whole-genome sequenced and comparative analyses were carried out with a focus on SNPs discovery to discriminate regional sub-groups of strains.RESULTS: A total of 1581 chromosomal SNPs precisely establish the phylogenetic relationships existing between the French strains. Phylogeography patterns within the three canSNP sub-lineages present in France (i.e. B.Br.CNEVA, A.Br.011/009 and A.Br.001/002) were observed. One of the more remarkable findings was the identification of a variety of genotypes within the A.Br.011/009 sub-group that are persisting in the different regions of France. The 560 SNPs defining the A.Br.011/009- affiliated French strains split the Trans-Eurasian sub-group into six distinct branches without any intermediate nodes. Distinct sub-branches, with some geographic clustering, were resolved. The 345 SNPs defining the major B.Br CNEVA sub-lineage clustered three main phylogeographic clades, the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Massif Central, with a small SaÃ´ne-et-Loire sub-cluster nested within the latter group. The French strains affiliated to the minor A.Br.001/002 group were characterized by 226 SNPs. All recent isolates collected from the Doubs department were closely related. Identification of SNPs from whole-genome sequences facilitates high-resolution strain tracking and provides the level of discrimination required for outbreak investigations. Eight diagnostic SNPs, representative of the main French-specific phylogeographic clusters, were therefore selected and developed into high-resolution melting SNP discriminative assays.CONCLUSIONS: This work has established one of the most accurate phylogenetic reconstruction of B. anthracis population structure in a country.

The epidemiology investigation of avian influenza virus was performed in Dongting lake wetland which is an international important wetland.RESULTS: An H10N8 influenza virus was isolated from Dongting Lake wetland in 2007. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the virus was generated by multiple gene segment reassortment. The isolate was lowly pathogenic for chickens. However, it replicated efficiently in the mouse lung without prior adaptation, and the virulence to mice increased rapidly during adaptation in mouse lung. Sequence analysis of the genome of viruses from different passages showed that multiple amino acid changes were involved in the adaptation of the isolates to mice.CONCLUSIONS: The water might be an important component in the transmission cycle of avian influenza virus, and other subtypes of avian influenza viruses (other than H5, H7 and H9) might evolve to pose a potential threat to mammals and even humans.",PMC3038951,10.1186/1743-422X-8-42,phylogeny;reservoir,Haemophilus Influenza,21978155,,

Vaccine against this virus is important for coping with its potential threat. Chimpanzee adenovirus (Ad) vectors are a novel type of vaccine vectors that share the advantages of human serotype Ad vectors but without being affected by pre-existing human neutralizing antibody to the vaccine vector. Based on a replication-deficient chimpanzee Ad vector, AdC7, we generated a novel H5N1 vaccine candidate AdC7-H5HA that expresses H5N1 Hemagglutinin(HA). When tested in mice, the vaccine significantly reduced the virus load and pathological lesions in the lung tissues, and conferred complete protection against lethal challenge by a homologous virus. Mechanistically, the AdC7-H5HA vaccine can induce both HA-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice. Also, sera transfer experiments demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies alone could provide protection. In conclusion, our results show that chimpanzee Ad vector expressing influenza virus HA may represent a promising vaccine candidate for H5N1 viruses and other influenza virus subtypes.",NA,NA,vaccine;vector,Haemophilus Influenza,22184438,,

Globally coordinated virological and epidemiological surveillance is the foundation of the influenza vaccine virus selection and development process. Although national influenza surveillance and reporting capabilities are being strengthened and expanded, sustaining and building upon recent gains has become a major challenge. Strengthening the vaccine virus selection process additionally requires the continuation of initiatives to improve the timeliness and representativeness of influenza viruses shared by countries for detailed analysis by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). Efforts are also continuing at the national, regional, and global levels to better understand the dynamics of influenza transmission in both temperate and tropical regions. Improved understanding of the degree of influenza seasonality in tropical countries of the world should allow for the strengthening of national vaccination policies and use of the most appropriate available vaccines. There remain a number of limitations and difficulties associated with the use of HAI assays for the antigenic characterization and selection of influenza vaccine viruses by WHOCCs. Current approaches to improving the situation include the more-optimal use of HAI and other assays; improved understanding of the data produced by neutralization assays; and increased standardization of serological testing methods. A number of new technologies and associated tools have the potential to revolutionize influenza surveillance and response activities. These include the increasingly routine use of whole genome next-generation sequencing and other high-throughput approaches. Such approaches could not only become key elements in outbreak investigations but could drive a new surveillance paradigm. However, despite the advances made, significant challenges will need to be addressed before next-generation technologies become routine, particularly in low-resource settings. Emerging approaches and techniques such as synthetic genomics, systems genetics, systems biology and mathematical modelling are capable of generating potentially huge volumes of highly complex and diverse datasets. Harnessing the currently theoretical benefits of such bioinformatics (&quot;big data&quot;) concepts for the influenza vaccine virus selection and development process will depend upon further advances in data generation, integration, analysis and dissemination. Over the last decade, growing awareness of influenza as an important global public health issue has been coupled to ever-increasing demands from the global community for more-equitable access to effective and affordable influenza vaccines. The current influenza vaccine landscape continues to be dominated by egg-based inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, with a small number of cell-based and recombinant vaccines. Successfully completing each step in the annual influenza vaccine manufacturing cycle will continue to rely upon timely and regular communication between the WHO GISRS, manufacturers and regulatory authorities. While the pipeline of influenza vaccines appears to be moving towards a variety of niche products in the near term, it is apparent that the ultimate aim remains the development of effective &quot;universal&quot; influenza vaccines that offer longer-lasting immunity against a broad range of influenza A subtypes.",NA,NA,vaccine;outbreak,Haemophilus Influenza,22184438,,

Inflammation plays a key role in pancreatic carcinogenesis, but it is unclear what causes local inflammation, other than pancreatitis. Epidemiological data suggest that Helicobacter pylori may be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, and more recently, data suggest that periodontal disease, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen for periodontal disease, may also play a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Individuals with periodontal disease have elevated markers of systemic inflammation, and oral bacteria can disseminate into the blood, stomach, heart and even reach the brain. These infections may contribute to the progression of pancreatic cancer by acting jointly with other pancreatic cancer risk factors that impact the inflammation and immune response, such as smoking and obesity, and the ABO genetic variant, recently linked to pancreatic cancer through genome-wide association studies. The complex interplay between bacteria, host immune response and environmental factors has been examined closely in relation to gastric cancer, but new research suggests bacteria may be playing a role in other gastrointestinal cancers. This review will summarize the literature on epidemiological studies examining infections that have been linked to pancreatic cancer and propose mechanistic pathways that may tie infections to pancreatic cancer.",PMC3786384,10.1093/carcin/bgt249,cancer;genome,Helicobacter pylori,22189161,,

Macrorestriction analysis of genomic DNA revealed that these four isolates are closely related to each other and can be classified as a newly emerged pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type among cattle: cluster VII. Three of the four isolates showed resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs), and this resistance was mediated by AmpC Î_-lactamase encoded by the bla(CMY-2) gene in a 190-kbp IncA/C plasmid. Results of restriction analysis and IncA/C backbone PCR suggest that the three 190-kbp plasmids are identical and that a 70-kbp IncA/C plasmid of the ESC-susceptible isolate is derived from the 190-kbp plasmid by a deletion event. Three isolates harboured a virulence-resistance plasmid (165 or 180 kbp), and restriction analysis revealed that these plasmids were identical or closely related to each other. These results suggest that the four S. Typhimurium cluster VII isolates originate from a common ancestor that probably invaded the farm prior to the salmonellosis outbreak.

Simultaneous detection and enumeration of L. monocytogenes were performed on 105 fruits, each weighing 127 to 145 g, collected from 7 contaminated lots. The results showed that 53.3% of the fruits yielded L. monocytogenes (lower limit of detection, 5 CFU/fruit), and the levels ranged from 5 to 2,850 CFU/fruit, with a geometric mean of 11.3 CFU/fruit (0.1 CFU/g of fruit).

Recent in vitro studies show that the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) protein family members potently restrict the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses. Both the magnitude and breadth of the IFITM proteins' in vitro effects suggest that they are critical for intrinsic resistance to such viruses, including influenza viruses. Using a knockout mouse model, we now test this hypothesis directly and find that IFITM3 is essential for defending the host against influenza A virus in vivo. Mice lacking Ifitm3 display fulminant viral pneumonia when challenged with a normally low-pathogenicity influenza virus, mirroring the destruction inflicted by the highly pathogenic 1918 'Spanish' influenza. Similar increased viral replication is seen in vitro, with protection rescued by the re-introduction of Ifitm3. To test the role of IFITM3 in human influenza virus infection, we assessed the IFITM3 alleles of individuals hospitalized with seasonal or pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses. We find that a statistically significant number of hospitalized subjects show enrichment for a minor IFITM3 allele (SNP rs12252-C) that alters a splice acceptor site, and functional assays show the minor CC genotype IFITM3 has reduced influenza virus restriction in vitro. Together these data reveal that the action of a single intrinsic immune effector, IFITM3, profoundly alters the course of influenza virus infection in mouse and humans.",PMC3648786,10.1038/nature10921,outbreak;hospital,Haemophilus Influenza,22379077,,

Multivariable models were built by conducting forward stepwise selection procedures.RESULTS: In the final logistic regression model, the HLA-B44 supertype was protective against dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in secondary infections (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI], .30-.72), while the HLA-A02 supertype (OR = 1.92, 95% CI, 1.30-2.83) and the HLA-A01/03 supertype (OR = 3.01, 95% CI, 1.01-8.92) were associated with susceptibility to secondary dengue fever. The B07 supertype was associated with susceptibility to secondary DHF in the univariate analysis (OR = 1.60, 95% CI, 1.05-2.46), whereas that was not retained in the final model.CONCLUSIONS: As the HLA-B44 supertype is predicted to target conserved epitopes in dengue, our results suggest that B44 supertype-restricted immune responses to highly conserved regions of the dengue proteome may protect against secondary DHF.",PMC4548457,10.1093/infdis/jiv127,clinical;outcome,Dengue virus,22411105,,

In this study, it is essential to undertake a genome-scale analysis to investigate the evolutionary processes in a global perspective. There was local phylogenetic divergence among eight trees based on individual segments of 132 strains. We detected four reassortments between four distinct groups of viruses divided by HA gene, suggesting intrasubtype reassortment could accelerate the emergence of highly pathogenic virus. The molecular clock estimated that H7N7 virus evolved at a slower evolutionary rate ranged from 1.03E-03 to 2.81E-03subs/site/year. And we also showed that all gene segments of the virus were under strong purifying selection. A total of 11 positively selected sites were detected by at least two out of three methods. We reconstructed the population dynamics of global H7N7 viruses spanning over a century, revealing that temporal trends of the effective population size were consistent with the major epidemics previously reported. Our study adopt a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to investigate the geographic spread of H7N7 viruses, which combined with temporal and spatial information of all sequences. We have confirmed several migration events between different geographic locations supported by higher values of Bayes factor. The diffusion patterns of H7N7 viruses reveal that the virus is more likely to evolve to expand their host ranges even cross the species.",NA,NA,geography;clinical,Haemophilus Influenza,22623997,,

Importantly, recent advances in high-throughput genome sequencing enable researchers to reveal the genomic diversity of these viral pathogens at much lower cost and with much greater precision than they could before. In particular, the genome sequence data generated allow inferences to be made on the molecular basis of viral emergence, evolution, and spread in human populations in real time. In this review, we introduce recent computational methods that analyze viral genomic data, particularly in combination with metadata such as sampling time, geographic location, and virulence.

Over the years, the approaches through family, twins and adoption studies led to the identification of some causal genes in monogenic forms of obesity but the origins of the pandemic of obesity cannot be considered essentially due to genetic factors, because human genome is not likely to change in just a few years. Epigenetic studies have offered in recent years valuable tools for the understanding of the worldwide spread of the pandemic of obesity. The involvement of epigenetic modifications-DNA methylation, histone tails, and miRNAs modifications-in the development of obesity is more and more evident. In the epigenetic literature, there are evidences that the entire embryo-fetal and perinatal period of development plays a key role in the programming of all human organs and tissues. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms involved in the epigenetic programming require a new and general pathogenic paradigm, the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease theory, to explain the current epidemiological transition, that is, the worldwide increase of chronic, degenerative, and inflammatory diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Obesity and its related complications are more and more associated with environmental pollutants (obesogens), gut microbiota modifications and unbalanced food intake, which can induce, through epigenetic mechanisms, weight gain, and altered metabolic consequences.",NA,NA,drug resistance;mBio;genome;diversity,Microbiota,22750803,,

In this region, all four dengue virus serotypes are persistently present. Major dengue outbreak cycle occurs in a cyclical pattern involving the different dengue virus serotypes. In Malaysia, since the 1980s, the major outbreak cycles have involved dengue virus type 3 (DENV3), dengue virus type 1 (DENV1) and dengue virus type 2 (DENV2), occurring in that order (DENV3/DENV1/DENV2). Only limited information on the DENV3 cycles, however, have been described. In the current study, we examined the major outbreak cycle involving DENV3 using data from 1981 to 2016. We examined the genetic diversity of DENV3 isolates obtained during the period when DENV3 was the dominant serotype and during the inter-dominant transmission period. Results obtained suggest that the typical DENV3/DENV1/DENV2 cyclical outbreak cycle in Malaysia has recently been disrupted. The last recorded major outbreak cycle involving DENV3 occurred in 2002, and the expected major outbreak cycle involving DENV3 in 2008-2012 did not materialize. DENV genome analyses revealed that DENV3 genotype II (DENV3/II) was the predominant DENV3 genotype (67%-100%) recovered between 1987 and 2002. DENV3 genotype I (DENV3/I) emerged in 2002 followed by the introduction of DENV3 genotype III (DENV3/III) in 2008. These newly emerged DENV3 genotypes replaced DENV3/II, but there was no major upsurge of DENV3 cases that accompanied the emergence of these viruses. DENV3 remained in the background of DENV1 and DENV2 until now. Virus genome sequence analysis suggested that intrinsic differences within the different dengue virus genotypes could have influenced the transmission efficiency of DENV3.

By analyzing the genome sequence of H. pylori isolated in North, Central and South America, we found evidence for admixture between H. pylori of European and African origin throughout the Americas, without substantial input from pre-Columbian (hspAmerind) bacteria. In the US, strains of African and European origin have remained genetically distinct, while in Colombia and Nicaragua, bottlenecks and rampant genetic exchange amongst isolates have led to the formation of national gene pools. We found three outer membrane proteins with atypical levels of Asian ancestry in American strains, as well as alleles that were nearly fixed specifically in South American isolates, suggesting a role for the ethnic makeup of hosts in the colonization of incoming strains. Our results show that new H. pylori subpopulations can rapidly arise, spread and adapt during times of demographic flux, and suggest that differences in transmission ecology between high and low prevalence areas may substantially affect the composition of bacterial populations.",PMC5322909,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006546,genome;diversity,Helicobacter pylori,23235784,,

Emergence of resistance to antibiotics possesses a challenge to the effort to eradicate H. pylori using conventional antibiotic-based therapies. The molecular mechanisms that contribute to the resistance of these strains have yet to be identified and are important for understanding the evolutional pattern and selective pressure imposed by the environment.METHODS AND FINDINGS: H. pylori was isolated from 102 patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal diseases, who underwent endoscopy at University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). The isolates were tested for their susceptibility on eleven antibiotics using Etest. Based on susceptibility test, 32.3% of the isolates were found to have primary metronidazole resistance; followed by clarithromycin (6.8%) and fluoroquinolones (6.8%). To further investigate the resistant strains, mutational patterns of gene rdxA, frxA, gyrA, gyrB, and 23S rRNA were studied. Consistent with the previous reports, metronidazole resistance was prevalent in the local population. However, clarithromycin, fluoroquinolone and multi-drug resistance were shown to be emerging. Molecular patterns correlated well with phenotypic data. Interestingly, multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains were found to be associated with higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) than their single-drug resistant (SDR) counterparts. Most importantly, clarithromycin-resistant strains were suggested to have a higher incidence for developing multi-drug resistance.CONCLUSION: Data from this study highlighted the urgency to monitor closely the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the Malaysian population; especially that of clarithromycin and multi-drug resistance. Further study is needed to understand the molecular association between clarithromycin resistance and multi-drug resistance in H. pylori. The report serves a reminder that a strict antibiotic usage policy is needed in Malaysia and other developing countries (especially those where H. pylori prevalence remained high).",PMC4086822,10.1371/journal.pone.0101481,drug resistance;mBio;characterization,Helicobacter pylori,23235784,,

Thirty stool samples from preterm neonates with NEC (n = 15) and controls (n = 15) were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing and culture-based methods. The results led us to develop a specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for Clostridium butyricum, and we tested stool samples from preterm neonates with NEC (n = 93) and controls (n = 270).

Risk factors for NEC include prematurity, formula feeding, and inappropriate microbial colonization of the GI tract. The pathogenesis of NEC is believed to involve weakening of the intestinal barrier by perinatal insults, translocation of luminal bacteria across the weakened barrier, an exuberant inflammatory response, and exacerbation of the barrier damage by inflammatory factors, leading to a vicious cycle of inflammation-inflicted epithelial damage. Nitric oxide (NO), produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and reactive NO oxidation intermediates play a prominent role in the intestinal barrier damage by inducing enterocyte apoptosis and inhibiting the epithelial restitution processes, namely enterocyte proliferation and migration. The factors that govern iNOS upregulation in the intestine are not well understood, which hampers efforts in developing NO/iNOS-targeted therapies. Similarly, efforts to identify bacteria or bacterial colonization patterns associated with NEC have met with limited success, because the same bacterial species can be found in NEC and in non-NEC subjects. However, microbiome studies have identified the three important characteristics of early bacterial populations of the GI tract: high diversity, low complexity, and fluidity. Whether NEC is caused by specific bacteria remains a matter of debate, but data from hospital outbreaks of NEC strongly argue in favor of the infectious nature of this disease. Studies in Cronobacter muytjensii have established that the ability to induce NEC is the property of specific strains rather than the species as a whole. Progress in our understanding of the roles of bacteria in NEC will require microbiological experiments and genome-wide analysis of virulence factors.",PMC4894644,10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2015.10.006,outbreak;hospital;genome;diversity,Microbiota,23345269,,

But the incidence of TB varies by public health units. The priority for TB control would be lowering in the areas where the incidence of TB is relatively low. In addition, younger age groups get low prevalence of TB infection than elderly persons. As a result, fewer experiences for TB diagnosis and treatment in the hospital and the medical facility would cause the delay in the detection of TB patients which eventually cause outbreaks. Although there are differences in population density and population mobility between urban and rural areas, the socially economic vulnerable patients and foreign patients are the common risks. Any public health units' policies of TB should correspond to the individual situation. At the era of low tuberculosis incidence, the infection risk is to be &quot;From ubiquitous to the uneven distribution&quot;. This makes TB detection much more difficult. At this symposium, each speaker presented the case for actually experienced with QFT test and/or VNTR analysis. They mainly focused on the paradigm shift in TB control which is indispensable for resolving the gaps in regional differences and the differences in diagnostic capability. Although the cases in this symposium were not for the low incidence situation, the pioneering approaches presented here would boost the future application of QFT and VNTR analysis nationwide. The discussions also partially covered the technical infrastructure for molecular epidemiology which covers the whole country. By making full use of QFT test and VNTR analysis as a contact screening tool, we can appropriately understand the risk of TB infection in the region from a buildup of bacteria and patient information. Now is the time to prepare for. Active surveillance of TB by this way would clarify the risk of the disease and lead to the advocacy essential for the resolution. 1. Current situation and challenge of contact survey by using QFT test in Tokyo: Hideo MAEDA (Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health, Tokyo Metropolitan Government). 2. Contact investigation of a tuberculosis outbreak: Kenichi MIYAMOTO (Takaido Community Health Center). We have experienced a TB outbreak in integrated junior and senior high school in Tokyo. Index patient was a student with persistent respiratory symptoms for six months before diagnosis of sputum smear-positive TB. Public health center started contact investigation immediately. QFT-positive rates were high in close contacts, especially in classmates. Additionally, a student outside of contact investigation was diagnosed as TB and considered to be infected from the first patient by VNTR analysis. Therefore, public health center expanded QFT-tests to all students and teachers in this school. Finally, 9 students and 2 teachers in this school were diagnosed as sputum smear-negative TB by contact investigation. 3. Utilization of molecular epidemiological procedure in contact investigation in Kyoto City: Masahiro ITO (Public Health Center of Kyoto City) Molecular epidemiological procedure using VNTR analysis has been used for contact investigation of tuberculosis since January 2011 in Kyoto City. One hundred forty four strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients with tuberculosis were investigated and 130 strains were fully analyzed. Fourteen clusters were found and the number of strains included in the cluster was ranged from two to 11. Epidemiological relationship between patients in one cluster was found, however, significant relationship in another clusters was not demonstrated. It was suggested that VNTR analysis is useful for molecular epidemiological analysis of tuberculosis. 4. The population based molecular epidemiological studies and QFT test in a contact examination: Riyo FUJIYAMA, Keisuke MATSUBAYASHI, Setsuko MIZUSHIRI, Junko HIGUCHIL Chika SHIRAI, Yuko KATAGAMI, Mieko CHIHARA, Akihiro IJICHI (Kobe City Public Health Center), Kentaro ARIKAWA, Noriko NAKANISHI, Tomotada IWAMOTO (Kobe Institute of Health). The population based molecular epidemiological studies should be made good use of contacts examination. In future, we expect the tuberculosis molecular epdimiological study improve search for the process of tuberculosis infection. The QFT positive rates correlated well with closeness of contact. QFT test is considered useful for diagnosing tuberculosis infection. However, in the judgment of tuberculosis infection, we should consider the total result of contact investigation not only QFT test but also the contact situation. 5. Insights into the TB epidemiology through population based molecular epidemiological studies: Tomotada IWAMOTO (Kobe Institute of Health) The population based molecular epidemiological studies unveiled the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis at bacterial clone level. This provides scientific evidences for achieving better TB control programs. In the advanced stage of the tuberculosis molecular epidemiological study, we expect to change the current geno-typing based molecular epidemiology to whole genome-typing based molecular epidemiology on the basis of the rapid innovation of next-generation sequencing technology.",NA,NA,transmission;outbreak;genotype;genome;control,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,23382983,,

Spoligotyping is a first-line genotypic fingerprinting method for M.tuberculosis isolates. An international online database (SpolDB4) of spoligotype patterns has been established wherein a clustered pattern (shared by â‰¥2 isolates) is designated a shared international type (SIT). Dual infections of single patients by distinct strains of M. tuberculosis is increasingly reported in high tuberculosis incidence areas, raising the possibility of false composite spoligotype patterns if performed upon mixed strain samples. A computational approach was applied to SpolDB4 and found that of the reported 1939 SITs, 54% could be a composite of two other SITs. Although many of the spoligotypes listed in SpolDB4 may be the product of admixing, the majority of patterns were reported with a corresponding low case frequency and so the effect of misclassification upon database integrity with these is likely minimal. Phylogenetic analysis of the five SITs most prone to be a composite demonstrated that these patterns designate nodes from which the ramifications of large families T, MANU, LAM, and EAI emerged. We illustrate how geographic context may indicate when an observed pattern could be the product of mixed infection. Importantly, when one of the most composite-prone SITs is obtained, further genetic testing by alternate methods is prudent to rule-out mixed infection, especially in high tuberculosis prevalence areas. These findings have broad practical implications for tuberculosis control and surveillance, as well as highlight the utility of a computational approach in providing solutions to biological questions in which the information can be digitalized.",NA,NA,genotype;phylogeny;control,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,23382983,,

Samples were sequentially collected from newly diagnosed HIV-infected 16- to 25-year olds in these 3 regions from 2009 to 2013. The viral genome was extracted, and the partial pol gene was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses were used to determine HIV-1 subtypes and CRF01_AE clusters. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) mutations were identified using the 2009 WHO list of TDR mutations. A total of 216 sequences were obtained from CRF01_AE strains, which accounted for 83.1% of the 260 genotyped samples, of which 36 were from Hezhou, 147 from Liuzhou, and 33 in Nanning. Most (83.3%, 180/216) were from heterosexuals, followed by injection drug users (5.6%), homosexuals (4.2%), and unknown risk group (6.9%). Based on phylogenetic analyses by the maximum likelihood method, 5 distinct clusters (cluster 1-5) were identified with 213 (98.6%) sequences, whereas 3 (1.4%) sequences were ungrouped. In Hezhou, 88.9% (32/36) of CRF01_AE infections were caused by cluster 2, and 11.1% (4/36) were caused by cluster 1. In Liuzhou, 83.0% (122/147) of the CRF01_AE strains were found in cluster 1, 11.6% (17/147) from cluster 2, 1.4% (2/147) from cluster 3, 2.7% (4/147) from cluster 4, and 0.7% (1/147) from cluster 5. The distribution of CRF01_AE clusters was more even in Nanning than it was in the other 2 regions, with 18.2% (6/33) from cluster 1, 36.3% (12/33) from cluster 2, 9.1% (3/33) from cluster 3, 18.2% (6/33) from cluster 4, and 12.1% (4/33) from cluster 5. The most frequent TDR mutations were M46I (2) in the protease region and Y181C (2) from the reverse transcriptase fragment. Clusters 1 and 2 of CRF01_AE strains were prevalent in Liuzhou and Hezhou, respectively. However, multiple CRF01_AE clusters existed in Nanning. This can be partially explained by the high mobility of laborers in Nanning, the capital city of Guangxi.

The first circulating recombinant form of HIV-1 to be identified was CRF01_AE, which originated in Central Africa and is now most prevalent in Southeast and East Asia. In this study, we investigated the timescale, evolutionary history, and population genetics of the HIV-1 CRF01_AE strains primarily responsible for the epidemic in Asia. A further aim of our study was to define and standardize the nomenclature and provide well-characterized reference sequences for the phylogenetic transmission clusters of CRF01_AE. We analysed a data set of 334 near-complete genome sequences from various risk groups, sampled between 1990 and 2011 from nine countries. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences were performed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Our study confirms that the diversity of HIV-1 CRF01_AE originated in Central Africa in the mid-1970s, was introduced into Thailand between 1979 and 1982, and began expanding there shortly afterwards (1982-1984). Subsequently, multiple clusters significantly contributed to China's HIV epidemic. A Bayesian skyline plot revealed the rapid expansion of CRF01_AE in China around 1999-2000. We identified at least eight different clusters of HIV-1 CRF01_AE formed by rapid expansion into different risk groups and geographic regions in China since the late 1980s.",NA,NA,outbreak;transmission;surveillance;genome;phylogeny;characterization;geography,Human Immunodeficy Virus,23468093,,

A representative subset of VREfm isolates (nâ€_=â€_18) and vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium (VSEfm, nâ€_=â€_2) reflecting the spread in time and location was approached by an array of methods including: selective whole genome sequencing (WGS; nâ€_=â€_3), multi locus sequence typing (MLST), antimicrobial susceptibility testing, virulence gene profiling, identification of mobile genetic elements conferring glycopeptide resistance and their ability to support glycopeptide resistance transfer. In addition, a single VREfm strain with an unrelated PFGE pattern collected prior to the outbreak was examined by WGS. MLST revealed a predominance of ST192, belonging to a hospital adapted high-risk lineage harbouring several known virulence determinants (nâ‰¥10). The VREfm outbreak strain was resistant to ampicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, and susceptible to teicoplanin. Consistently, a vanB2-subtype as part of Tn1549/Tn5382 with a unique genetic signature was identified in the VREfm outbreak strains. Moreover, Southern blot hybridisation analyses of PFGE separated S1 nuclease-restricted total DNAs and filter mating experiments showed that vanB2-Tn1549/Tn5382 was located in a 70-kb sized rep17/pRUM plasmid readily transferable between E. faecium. This plasmid contained an axe-txe toxin-antitoxin module associated with stable maintenance. The two clonally related VSEfm harboured a 40 kb rep17/pRUM plasmid absent of the 30 kb vanB2-Tn1549/Tn5382 gene complex. Otherwise, these two isolates were similar to the VREfm outbreak strain in virulence- and resistance profile. In conclusion, our observations support that the origin of the multicentre outbreak was caused by an introduction of vanB2-Tn1549/Tn5382 into a rep17/pRUM plasmid harboured in a pre-existing high-risk E. faecium ST192 clone.

Data on the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant organisms are scarce for Africa, especially in HIV-infected individuals who often have frequent contact with healthcare. We investigated the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) carriage in stool among HIV-infected children attending an HIV outpatient department in Harare, Zimbabwe.METHODS: We recruited children who were stable on antiretroviral therapy (ART) attending a HIV clinic from August 2014 to June 2015. Information was collected on antibiotic use and hospitalization. Stool was tested for ESBL-E through combination disc diffusion. API20E identification and antimicrobial susceptibility was performed on the positive samples followed by whole genome sequencing.RESULTS: Stool was collected from 175/202 (86.6â€_%) children. Median age was 11 [inter-quartile range (IQR) 9-12] years. Median time on ART was 4.6 years (IQR 2.4-6.4). ESBL-Es were found in 24/175 samples (13.7â€_%); 50â€_% of all ESBL-Es were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 100â€_% to co-trimoxazole, 45.8â€_% to chloramphenicol, 91.6â€_% to ceftriaxone, 20.8â€_% to gentamicin and 62.5â€_% to ciprofloxacin. ESBL-Es variously encoded CTX-M, OXA, TEM and SHV enzymes. The odds of ESBL-E carriage were 8.5 times (95â€_%â€‰CI 2.2-32.3) higher in those on ART for less than one year (versus longer) and 8.5 times (95â€_%â€‰CI 1.1-32.3) higher in those recently hospitalized for a chest infection.CONCLUSION: We found a 13.7â€_% prevalence of ESBL-E carriage in a population where ESBL-E carriage has not been described previously.

For this reason, leukocyte infiltration profile and p53 codon 72 polymorphisms were assessed in freshly removed HNSCC specimens (N=71 patients). HPV detection was performed by nested-PCR followed by DNA sequencing. Viral loads were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The choice to investigate fresh instead of archive paraffin-embedded specimens was privileged to avoid possible artifacts due to sample processing. HPV DNA was detected in 14% of cases. Oropharyngeal carcinomas were the most frequently associated with the presence of HPV16 DNA (41%) and were associated with p53 Pro/Pro or Pro/Arg polymorphisms. In HPV16-positive oropharyngeal carcinomas increased infiltrations of CD3+ and FoxP3+ T-cells correlated with higher HPV16 copy numbers. The presence of HPV may trigger a stronger immune response and may be considered a reliable marker for clinical staging and a more favorable prognosis of oropharyngeal carcinoma.",NA,NA,clinical;diagnosis;cancer,Human Papillomavirus,23932809,,

There is now an epidemic of HPV positive oropharyngeal cancers (HPV16 is responsible for 80-90% of these); therefore increased understanding of the HPV16 life cycle in oral keratinocytes is a priority. To date there have been limited reports characterizing the HPV16 life cycle in oral keratinocytes. Using TERT immortalized &quot;normal&quot; oral keratinocytes (NOKs) we generated clonal cell lines maintaining the HPV16 genome as an episome, NOKs+HPV16. Organotypic raft cultures demonstrated appropriate expression of differentiation markers, E1^E4 and E2 expression along with amplification of the viral genome in the upper layers of the epithelium. Using this unique system RNA-seq analysis revealed extensive gene regulation of the host genome by HPV16; many of the changes have not been observed for HPV16 before. The RNA-seq data was validated on a key set of anti-viral innate immune response genes repressed by HPV16 in NOKs+HPV16. We show that the behavior of these NOKs+HPV16 lines is identical to HPV16 immortalized human tonsil keratinocytes with regards innate gene regulation. Finally, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data we examined gene expression patterns from HPV positive and negative head and neck cancers and demonstrate this innate immune gene signature set is also downregulated in HPV positive cancers versus negative. Our system provides a model for understanding HPV16 transcriptional regulation of oral keratinocytes that is directly relevant to HPV positive head and neck cancer.",NA,NA,cancer;genome,Human Papillomavirus,23932809,,

Many studies have focused on the epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of A. baumannii, but little is currently known with respect to its virulence potential.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The aim of this work was to analyze a number of virulence-related traits of four A. baumannii strains of different origin and clinical impact for which complete genome sequences were available, in order to tentatively identify novel determinants of A. baumannii pathogenicity. Clinical strains showed comparable virulence in the Galleria mellonella model of infection, irrespective of their status as outbreak or sporadic strains, whereas a non-human isolate was avirulent. A combined approach of genomic and phenotypic analyses led to the identification of several virulence factors, including exoproducts with hemolytic, phospholipase, protease and iron-chelating activities, as well as a number of multifactorial phenotypes, such as biofilm formation, surface motility and stress resistance, which were differentially expressed and could play a role in A. baumannii pathogenicity.SIGNIFICANCE: This work provides evidence of the multifactorial nature of A. baumannii virulence. While A. baumannii clinical isolates could represent a selected population of strains adapted to infect the human host, subpopulations of highly genotypically and phenotypically diverse A. baumannii strains may exist outside the hospital environment, whose relevance and distribution deserve further investigation.",PMC3148234,10.1371/journal.pone.0022674,genome;drug resistance;characterization;outbreak;hospital,Acinetobact baumannii,23965155,,

Thus, last-line antibiotics like carbapenems are increasingly being used which in turn further augments selection pressure for resistant strains. Resistance to carbapenems in A. baumannii is frequently mediated by carbapenemases, particularly OXA-23 and OXA-58. Carbapenemase-producing bacteria are mainly described in human patients and the intestinal tract represents a common source for such pathogens. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the genome of A. baumannii IHIT7853, a carbapenem-resistant, OXA-23 producing strain isolated from cystitis in a cat in 2000 in Germany.RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that IHIT7853 belonged to the globally distributed international clone IC1 and MLST type ST1/ST231 (Pasteur/Oxford MLST scheme). A phylogenetic tree based on the maximum common genome of 18 A. baumannii isolates placed IHIT7853 close to human clinical isolates, such as the multidrug-resistantÂ (MDR) outbreak strain AYE that was isolated from a patient with pneumonia and cystitis in 2001 in France. The OXA-23 plasmid sequence could be determined as 53,995Â bp in size, possessing resistance genes strA and strB in addition to bla OXA-23.CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the genome of IHIT7853 reveals that companion animals carry MDR A. baumannii that resemble relevant clonal lineages involved in severe infections in humans. As urinary tract infections are often caused by bacteria that reside in the intestinal tract, future studies should unveil, if the animal gut serves as a source for MDR A. baumannii.",PMC4964143,10.1186/s13099-016-0119-z,genome;characterization;drug resistance;mBio;outbreak,Acinetobact baumannii,23965155,,

Î_-Lactam, or penicillin-type, antibiotics are among the most widely utilized antibiotics worldwide and may also adversely affect the microbiota. Many bacteria are capable, however, of producing Î_-lactamase enzymes that inactivate Î_-lactam antibiotics. We hypothesized that prior establishment of intestinal colonization with a Î_-lactamase-producing anaerobe might prevent these adverse effects of Î_-lactam antibiotics, by inactivating the portion of antibiotic that is excreted into the intestinal tract. Here, mice with a previously abolished microbiota received either oral normal saline or an oral cephalosporinase-producing strain of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron for 3 days. Mice then received 3 days of subcutaneous ceftriaxone, followed by either oral administration of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) or sacrifice and assessment of in vitro growth of epidemic and nonepidemic strains of Clostridium difficile in murine cecal contents. Stool concentrations of VRE and ceftriaxone were measured, cecal levels of C. difficile 24 h after incubation were quantified, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of microbial 16S rRNA genes was performed to evaluate the antibiotic effect on the microbiota. The results demonstrated that establishment of prior colonization with a Î_-lactamase-producing intestinal anaerobe inactivated intraintestinal ceftriaxone during treatment with this antibiotic, allowed recovery of the normal microbiota despite systemic ceftriaxone, and prevented overgrowth with VRE and epidemic and nonepidemic strains of C. difficile in mice.

The RD105 deletion-targeted multiplex PCR method identified 85 (85/110, 77.3%) MDR and 12 (12/13, 92.3%) XDR isolates as the Beijing genotype. MIRU-VNTR cluster analysis demonstrated that 101 MDR and 13 XDR strains had unique genotype patterns; the remaining 9 MDR strains were in 4 clusters, namely 1 cluster with 3 strains and 3 clusters with 2 strains, resulting in a low clustering rate (4.06%). The Hunter-Gaston discriminatory index (HGDI) of the 15-loci MIRU-VNTR method was as high as 0.992.

In this study, a scheme of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) was established for the phylogenetic and epidemiology analysis.METHODS: To establish the scheme of M. tuberculosis MLSA, the genome of H37Rv, CCDC5079 and CCDC5180 were compared, and some variable genes were chosen to be the MLSA typing scheme. 44 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates were typed by MLSA, IS6110-RFLP, and soligotyping, to evaluate the MLSA methods.RESULTS: After comparison of the genome, seven high discrimination gene loci (recX, rpsL, rmlC, rpmG1, mprA, gcvH, ideR) were chosen to be the MLSA typing scheme finally. 11 variable SNP sites of those seven genes were found among the 44 M. tuberculosis isolate strains and 11 sequence types (STs) were identified. Based on the Hunter-Gaston Index (HGI), MLSA typing was not as good for discrimination at the strain level as IS6110-RFLP, but the HGI was much better than that of spoligotyping. In addition, the MEGA analysis result of MLSA data was similar to spoligotyping/PGG lineage, showing a strong phylogenetic signal in the modern strains of M. tuberculosis. The MLSA data analysis by eBURST revealed that 4 sequence types (ST) came into a main cluster, showing the major clonal complexes in those 44 strains.CONCLUSION: MLSA genotyping not only can be used for molecular typing, but also is an ideal method for the phylogenetic analysis for M. tuberculosis.",NA,NA,outbreak;hospital;characterization;phylogeny,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,24047678,,

The HCV genome is translated into a polyprotein which is proteolytically processed into 10 viral proteins. The interactome of the HCV proteins with the host cell has been worked out; however, it remains unclear how viral proteins interact with each other. We aimed to generate the interaction network of these 10 HCV proteins using a flow-cytometry-based FRET assay established in our laboratory (Banning, C., Votteler, J., Hoffmann, D., Koppensteiner, H., Warmer, M., Reimer, R., Kirchhoff, F., Schubert, U., Hauber, J., and Schindler, M.

HCV proteins were constructed as fusions with the chromophores CFP and YFP. All HCV fusions were expressed and localized to specific subcellular compartments, indicating that they were functional. FACS-FRET measurements identified a total of 20 interactions; 13 of these were previously described and have now been confirmed in living cells via our method. Among the seven novel protein binding pairs, HCV p7 plays a pivotal role. It binds to the HCV capsid protein Core and the two glycoproteins E1 and E2. These interplays were further demonstrated in the relevant context of Huh7.5 liver cells expressing infectious HCV. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of rapidly generating small interaction networks via FACS-FRET and defines the network of intra-HCV protein interactions.

Stellate cells may transdifferentiate into progenitor cells and possibly be linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Viral proteins also have been implicated in several cellular signal transduction pathways that affect cell survival, proliferation, migration and transformation. Current advances in gene expression profile and selective messenger RNA analysis have improved approach to the pathogenesis of HCC. The heterogeneity of genetic events observed in HCV-related HCCs has suggested that complex mechanisms underlie malignant transformation induced by HCV infection.

Genome sequencing technologies are rapidly becoming a powerful tool in facilitating our understanding of how genotype, classification phenotypes, and virulence phenotypes interact to predict the health risks of individual bacterial isolates. Currently, 57 closed L. monocytogenes genomes are publicly available, representing three of the four phylogenetic lineages, and they suggest that L. monocytogenes has high genomic synteny. This study contributes an additional 15 closed L. monocytogenes genomes that were used to determine the associations between the genome and methylome with host invasion magnitude. In contrast to previous findings, large chromosomal inversions and rearrangements were detected in five isolates at the chromosome terminus and within rRNA genes, including a previously undescribed inversion within rRNA-encoding regions. Each isolate's epigenome contained highly diverse methyltransferase recognition sites, even within the same serotype and methylation pattern. Eleven strains contained a single chromosomally encoded methyltransferase, one strain contained two methylation systems (one system on a plasmid), and three strains exhibited no methylation, despite the occurrence of methyltransferase genes. In three isolates a new, unknown DNA modification was observed in addition to diverse methylation patterns, accompanied by a novel methylation system. Neither chromosome rearrangement nor strain-specific patterns of epigenome modification observed within virulence genes were correlated with serotype designation, clonal complex, or in vitro infectivity. These data suggest that genome diversity is larger than previously considered in L. monocytogenes and that as more genomes are sequenced, additional structure and methylation novelty will be observed in this organism.IMPORTANCE: Listeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of listeriosis, a disease which manifests as gastroenteritis, meningoencephalitis, and abortion. Among Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, and Listeria-causing the most prevalent foodborne illnesses-infection by L. monocytogenes carries the highest mortality rate. The ability of L. monocytogenes to regulate its response to various harsh environments enables its persistence and transmission. Small-scale comparisons of L. monocytogenes focusing solely on genome contents reveal a highly syntenic genome yet fail to address the observed diversity in phenotypic regulation. This study provides a large-scale comparison of 302 L. monocytogenes isolates, revealing the importance of the epigenome and restriction-modification systems as major determinants of L. monocytogenes phylogenetic grouping and subsequent phenotypic expression.

A multiple antimicrobial resistant ETEC O157 (O157 SvETEC) representative of O157 isolates from a pig farm in New South Wales, Australia that experienced repeated bouts of pre- and post-weaning diarrhoea resulting in multiple fatalities was characterized here. Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 cause both sporadic and widespread outbreaks of foodborne disease, predominantly have a ruminant origin and belong to the ST11 clonal complex. Here, for the first time, we conducted comparative genomic analyses of two epidemiologically-unrelated porcine, disease-causing ETEC O157; E. coli O157 SvETEC and E. coli O157:K88 734/3, and examined their phylogenetic relationship with EHEC O157:H7.RESULTS: O157 SvETEC and O157:K88 734/3 belong to a novel sequence type (ST4245) that comprises part of the ST23 complex and are genetically distinct from EHEC O157. Comparative phylogenetic analysis using PhyloSift shows that E. coli O157 SvETEC and E. coli O157:K88 734/3 group into a single clade and are most similar to the extraintestinal avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) isolate O78 that clusters within the ST23 complex. Genome content was highly similar between E. coli O157 SvETEC, O157:K88 734/3 and APEC O78, with variability predominantly limited to laterally acquired elements, including prophages, plasmids and antimicrobial resistance gene loci. Putative ETEC virulence factors, including the toxins STb and LT and the K88 (F4) adhesin, were conserved between O157 SvETEC and O157:K88 734/3. The O157 SvETEC isolate also encoded the heat stable enterotoxin STa and a second allele of STb, whilst a prophage within O157:K88 734/3 encoded the serum survival gene bor. Both isolates harbor a large repertoire of antibiotic resistance genes but their association with mobile elements remains undetermined.CONCLUSIONS: We present an analysis of the first draft genome sequences of two epidemiologically-unrelated, pathogenic ETEC O157.

Examples of the usefulness of molecular typing are source case finding and epidemiological linkage of tuberculosis (TB) cases, international transmission of MDR/XDR-TB, the discrimination between endogenous reactivation and exogenous re-infection as a cause of relapses after curative treatment of tuberculosis, the evidence of multiple M. tuberculosis infections, and the disclosure of laboratory cross-contaminations. Simultaneously, phylogenetic analyses were developed based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genomic deletions usually referred to as regions of difference (RDs) and spoligotyping which served both strain typing and phylogenetic analysis. National and international initiatives that rely on the application of these typing methods have brought significant insight into the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis. However, current DNA fingerprinting methods have important limitations. They can often not distinguish between genetically closely related strains and the turn-over of these markers is variable. Moreover, the suitability of most DNA typing methods for phylogenetic reconstruction is limited as they show a high propensity of convergent evolution or misinfer genetic distances. In order to fully explore the possibilities of genotyping in the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis and to study the phylogeny of the causative bacteria reliably, the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis for all M. tuberculosis isolates is the optimal, although currently still a costly solution. In the last years WGS for typing of pathogens has been explored and yielded important additional information on strain diversity in comparison to the classical DNA typing methods. With the ongoing cost reduction of DNA sequencing it is possible that WGS will become the sole diagnostic tool in the secondary laboratory diagnosis of tuberculosis for identification, drug susceptibility testing and genetic characterization.",NA,NA,genotype;characterization;drug resistance;genome;phylogeny;clinical;treatment,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,24412724,,

The presence of the esp gene and that of genes encoding resistance to glycopeptides was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All of the isolates were typed by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), and a selection of them also by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).RESULTS: We found that all of the VRE and 18 (78%) of the VSE strains belonged to the single clonal complex-17 (CC17). The most represented sequence type (ST) was ST78 (34% of the isolates). When further analyzed by PFGE, ST78 isolates were subdivided into five pulsotypes, four of them closely related.

In contrast to other enteropathogenic bacteria, Campylobacter has been considered to be non-glycolytic, a metabolic property originally used for their taxonomic classification. Contrary to this dogma, we demonstrate that several Campylobacter coli strains are able to utilize glucose as a growth substrate. Isotopologue profiling experiments with (13) C-labeled glucose suggested that these strains catabolize glucose via the pentose phosphate and Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathways and use glucose efficiently for de novo synthesis of amino acids and cell surface carbohydrates. Whole genome sequencing of glycolytic C. coli isolates identified a genomic island located within a ribosomal RNA gene cluster that encodes for all ED pathway enzymes and a glucose permease. We could show in vitro that a non-glycolytic C. coli strain could acquire glycolytic activity through natural transformation with chromosomal DNA of C. coli and C. jejuni subsp. doylei strains possessing the ED pathway encoding plasticity region.

We investigated biogeographical variation in highly recombining genes to determine the extent of clustering between genomes from geographically distinct Campylobacter populations. Whole-genome sequences from 294 Campylobacter isolates from North America and the UK were analysed. Isolates from within the same country shared more recently recombined DNA than isolates from different countries. Using 15 UK/American closely matched pairs of isolates that shared ancestors, we identify regions that have frequently and recently recombined to test their correlation with geographical origin. The seven genes that demonstrated the greatest clustering by geography were used in an attribution model to infer geographical origin which was tested using a further 383 UK clinical isolates to detect signatures of recent foreign travel. Patient records indicated that in 46 cases, travel abroad had occurred &lt;2Â weeks prior to sampling, and genomic analysis identified that 34 (74%) of these isolates were of a non-UK origin.

The gut microbiota is involved in gut permeability, low-grade inflammation and immune balance, it modulates dietary choline metabolism, regulates bile acid metabolism and produces endogenous ethanol. All of these factors are molecular mechanisms by which the microbiota can induce NAFLD or its progression toward overt non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.",NA,NA,drug resistance;mBio;genome;diversity,Microbiota,25314581,,

Horizontal transfers of genes among the microorganisms living within CF patients have led to highly virulent and multi-drug resistant strains such as the Liverpool epidemic strain of P. aeruginosa, namely the LESB58 strain that has the propensity to acquire virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Often these genes are acquired in large clusters, referred to as &quot;genomic islands (GIs).&quot; To decipher GIs and understand their contributions to the evolution of virulence and antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa LESB58, we utilized a recursive segmentation and clustering procedure, presented here as a genome-mining tool, &quot;GEMINI.&quot; GEMINI was validated on experimentally verified islands in the LESB58 strain before examining its potential to decipher novel islands. Of the 6062 genes in P. aeruginosa LESB58, 596 genes were identified to be resident on 20 GIs of which 12 have not been previously reported. Comparative genomics provided evidence in support of our novel predictions. Furthermore, GEMINI unraveled the mosaic structure of islands that are composed of segments of likely different evolutionary origins, and demonstrated its ability to identify potential strain biomarkers. These newly found islands likely have contributed to the hyper-virulence and multidrug resistance of the Liverpool epidemic strain of P. aeruginosa.",PMC4971588,10.3389/fmicb.2016.01210,drug resistance;vector;characterization;genome;outbreak,Pseudomona aeruginosa,25343711,,

Strains of main genotypes ST235, ST446, ST598 were isolated from patients of various surgical departments. Patients were shown to be colonized by these strains during stay in reanimation and intensive therapy department (RITD) of the hospital. Strains of dominant genotype 235 were isolated from 47% of examined patients during more than 3 years. Only genotype 235 strains contained integron with cassettes of antibiotics resistance genes blaGES5 and aadA6 in the genome.CONCLUSION: The data obtained show that over the period of observation in the center 1 clone of P. aeruginosa that belonged to genotype 235 dominated. This clone was endemic for this hospital and in the process of prolonged persistence became more resistant to antibiotics. Colonization of patients with these strains occurs in RITD.

Out of 20 MDR-TB cases, 12 different TB-SPRINT profiles were identified, limiting the suspicion of MDR-TB transmission. 24 MIRU-VNTR confirmed the unrelatedness of isolates with different TB-SPRINT profiles and discriminated 3 isolates with identical TB-SPRINT profiles. In conclusion, our study did not confirm any of the correlations between Multi-Drug Resistance and lineage or sublineage in Punjab, Pakistan.

The underlying drug resistance mechanisms, including the genetic variation favored by selective pressure in the resistant population, are partially understood. Recently, the first case of XDR-TB was reported in Malaysia. However, the detailed genotype family and mechanisms of the formation of multiple drugs resistance are unknown. We sequenced the whole genome of the UM 1072388579 strain with a 2-kb insert-size library and combined with that from previously sequenced 500-bp-insert paired-end reads to produce an improved sequence with maximal sequencing coverage across the genome. In silico spoligotyping and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that UM 1072388579 strain belongs to an ancestral-like, non-Beijing clade of East Asia lineage. This is supported by the presence of a number of lineage-specific markers, including fadD28, embA, nuoD and pks7. Polymorphism analysis showed that the drug-susceptibility profile is correlated with the pattern of resistance mutations. Mutations in drug-efflux pumps and the cell wall biogenesis pathway such as mmpL, pks and fadD genes may play an important role in survival and adaptation of this strain to its surrounding environment. In this work, fifty-seven putative promoter SNPs were identified. Among them, we identified a novel SNP located at -4 T allele of TetR/acrR promoter as an informative marker to recognize strains of East Asian lineage. Our work indicates that the UM 1072388579 harbors both classical and uncommon SNPs that allow it to escape from inhibition by many antibiotics.

Current vaccines may provide some protection for women from cervical carcinoma linked to HPV genotype 16 and 18. This may be the best vaccine for Western women, but the geographical variation in HPV distributions may not make it the most appropriate vaccine for China or Asia. This study provided an observational, retrospective, hospital-based cross-sectional study on the distribution of HPV genotypes among 5410 women with invasive cervical cancer (ICC) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Overall, the positive rates of the four HPV types included in current prophylactic vaccines were counted, the two high-risk types (HPV-16 and -18) covered by current vaccines represented 66.9% of women with squamous cancer, 55.0% with adenocarcinoma, 64.9% with adenosquamous carcinoma and 77.4% of other type ICC, as well as 59.5% of CIN III, 45.0% of CIN II and 38.1% of CIN I cases. As expected, two low-risk types (HPV-6 and -11) included in the quadrivalent vaccine did not show good coverage data. Particularly worth mentioning is the fact that the addition of HPV-52 and -58 to the vaccine cocktail would increase cancer protection in our population, potentially preventing up to beyond 16% of squamous/adenosquamous carcinoma and other type of cervical cancers, and 7.75% of adenocarcinomas. It might also potentially reduce the rate of CIN III by a further 28.6% and CIN II and I by a third.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of toxigenic V.parahaemolyticus in Italian coastal waters and seafood, to examine intra-species variability and to identify, using serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), relationships among strains from different sources, geographical origin and period of isolation.

Environmental swabs revealed VREfm colonization of baby-weighing scales, a baby bath, and a pharmacy refrigerator within the neonatal intensive care unit. All isolates were of a single multilocus sequence type (sequence type 796) and highly clonal at the core genome level.CONCLUSIONS: Bundled infection control interventions were effective in rapidly terminating a clonal outbreak of sequence type 796 VREfm colonization within a neonatal inpatient service. Strain-typing and active surveillance cultures were critical in guiding the management of this outbreak. The closed environment of a neonatal unit likely facilitated eradication of the patient and environment reservoirs of VREfm colonization.",NA,NA,control;outbreak;hospital;genome;drug resistance;genotype;characterization,Enterococcus faecium,26016565,,

Patients were tested for antibodies specific to these viruses; vaginal swabs and urine from the women and serum and urine from the newborns were tested for viral genome. The Fisher exact test with 95% confidence interval was used for comparisons.RESULTS: Of the women studied, 89.5% tested positive for cytomegalovirus and 83.2% for herpes simplex. Active infection from cytomegalovirus was detected in 16.7%, and from herpes simplex in 3.2%. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection was detected in 4.1% of newborns; no herpes simplex virus infection was found in this group. Two newborns of women with active cytomegalovirus infection were congenitally infected.CONCLUSIONS: Serology demonstrated that most of the women were immune to both viruses. Active cytomegalovirus infections are common in this population, and newborns of women with active cytomegalovirus infection during pregnancy are at increased risk of congenital infection.",NA,NA,genome,Human herpesvirus,26086165,,

Although alphaherpesviruses are disseminated in humans and other animals, there is little information about their distribution in bats. Here, we isolated a previously unknown alphaherpesvirus from an Indonesian fruit bat. Genome sequence analysis suggested that the virus is a member of the genus Simplexvirus within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, which also includes common human viruses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 and herpes simplex virus 2.

OHB was defined as detectable serum HBV DNA in the absence of HBsAg. Viral mutations associated with OHB were identified by comparison with matched controls that remained positive for HBsAg, and further characterized in vitro.RESULTS: The prevalence of OHB was 34.1% (15/44) in all patients, which was not significantly different among three groups. One mutation in surface promoter/polymerase region, C3050T (preS1T68I), was identified to be associated with the seroclearance of HBsAg in six cases. This mutation does not change the amino acid sequence of the polymerase protein. The S promoter activity was significantly lower in the construct containing C3050T mutation as compared with the wild-type (PÂ =Â 0.0008). However, this mutation did not affect HBV replication, transcription and translation in the context of the full-length HBV genome. OHB was not rare in patients with HBsAg seroclearance.CONCLUSIONS: One mutation, C3050T (preS1T68I), decreased S promoter activity; nevertheless, other factors may play more important role in the clearance of HBsAg in these OHB patients.",NA,NA,clinical;treatment;genome,Hepatitis B;Hepatitis C,26334654,,

It exhibits multiple mechanisms of resistance, including efflux pumps, antibiotic modifying enzymes and limited membrane permeability. The primary reason for the development of novel therapeutics for P. aeruginosa infections is the declining efficacy of conventional antibiotic therapy. These clinical problems caused a revitalization of interest in bacteriophages, which are highly specific and have very effective antibacterial activity as well as several other advantages over traditional antimicrobial agents. Above all, so far, no serious or irreversible side effects of phage therapy have been described. Five newly purified P. aeruginosa phages named vB_PaeM_WP1, vB_PaeM_WP2, vB_PaeM_WP3, vB_PaeM_WP4 and vB_PaeP_WP5 have been characterized as potential candidates for use in phage therapy. They are representatives of the Myoviridae and Podoviridae families. Their host range, genome size, structural proteins and stability in various physical and chemical conditions were tested.

For epidemiological purposes, discriminating P.aeruginosa isolates is a critical step, to define distribution of clones among hospital departments, to predict occurring microevolution events and to correlate clones to their source. A collection of 182 P. aeruginosa clinical strains isolated within Italian hospitals from patients with chronic infections, i.e. cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, and with acute infections were genotyped. Molecular typing was performed with the ArrayTube (AT) multimarker microarray (Alere Technologies GmbH, Jena, Germany), a cost-effective, time-saving and standardized method, which addresses genes from both the core and accessory P.aeruginosa genome. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were employed as reference genotyping techniques to estimate the ArrayTube resolution power.RESULTS: 41 AT-genotypes were identified within our collection, among which 14 were novel and 27 had been previously described in publicly available AT-databases. Almost 30% of the genotypes belonged to a main cluster of clones. 4B9A, EC2A, 3C2A were mostly associated to CF-patients whereas F469, 2C1A, 6C22 to non CF. An investigation on co-infections events revealed that almost 40% of CF patients were colonized by more than one genotype, whereas less than 4% were observed in non CF patients. The presence of the exoU gene correlated with non-CF patients within the intensive care unit (ICU) whereas the pKLC102-like island appeared to be prevalent in the CF centre. The congruence between the ArrayTube typing and PFGE or MLST was 0.077 and 0.559 (Adjusted Rand coefficient), respectively.AT typing of this Italian collection could be easily integrated with the global P. aeruginosa AT-typed population, uncovering that most AT-genotypes identified (&gt; 80%) belonged to two large clonal clusters, and included 12 among the most abundant clones of the global population.CONCLUSIONS: The ArrayTube (AT) multimarker array represented a robust and portable alternative to reference techniques for performing P. aeruginosa molecular typing, and allowed us to draw conclusions especially suitable for epidemiologists on an Italian clinical collection from chronic and acute infections.",PMC3431270,10.1186/1471-2180-12-152,characterization;outbreak;hospital;genotype,Pseudomona aeruginosa,26341705,,

In addition to its global distribution, S. Virchow is clinically significant due to the frequency at which it causes invasive infections and its association with outbreaks arising from food-borne transmission. Here, we examine the genome of an invasive isolate of S. Virchow SVQ1 (phage type 8) from an outbreak in southeast Queensland, Australia. In addition to identifying new potential genotyping targets that could be used for discriminating between S. Virchow strains in outbreak scenarios, we also aimed to carry out a comprehensive comparative analysis of the S. Virchow genomes.RESULTS: Genome comparisons between S. Virchow SVQ1 and S. Virchow SL491, a previously published strain, identified a high degree of genomic similarity between the two strains with fewer than 200 single nucleotide differences. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) regions were identified as a highly variable region that could be used to discriminate between S. Virchow isolates. We amplified and sequenced the CRISPR regions of fifteen S. Virchow isolates collected from seven different outbreaks across Australia. We observed three allelic types of the CRISPR region from these isolates based on the presence/absence of the spacers and were able to discriminate S. Virchow phage type 8 isolates originating from different outbreaks. A comparison with 27 published Salmonella genomes found that the S. Virchow SVQ1 genome encodes 11 previously described Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPI), as well as additional genomic islands including a remnant integrative conjugative element that is distinct from SPI-7. In addition, the S. Virchow genome possesses a novel prophage that encodes the Type III secretion system effector protein SopE, a key Salmonella virulence factor. The prophage shares very little similarity to the SopE prophages found in other Salmonella serovars suggesting an independent acquisition of sopE.CONCLUSIONS: The availability of this genome will serve as a genome template and facilitate further studies on understanding the virulence and global distribution of the S. Virchow serovar, as well as the development of genotyping methods for outbreak investigations.",PMC4042001,10.1186/1471-2164-15-389,genome;drug resistance;clinical;diagnosis;vector,Salmonella Enterica,26365161,,

Drug-resistant TB is a major threat worldwide. The variable and uncertain impact of TB control necessitates not only better tools (diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines), but also better insights into the natural history and epidemiology of TB. Molecular epidemiological studies over the last two decades have contributed to such insights by answering long-standing questions, such as the proportion of cases attributable to recent transmission, risk factors for recent transmission, the occurrence of multiple Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and the proportion of recurrent TB cases attributable to re-infection. M. tuberculosis lineages have been identified and shown to be associated with geographical origin. The Beijing genotype is strongly associated with multidrug resistance, and may have escaped from bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin-induced immunity. DNA fingerprinting has quantified the importance of institutional transmission and laboratory cross-contamination, and has helped to focus contact investigations. Questions to be answered in the near future with whole genome sequencing include identification of chains of transmission within clusters of patients, more precise quantification of mixed infection, and transmission probabilities and rates of progression from infection to disease of various M. tuberculosis lineages, as well as possible variations in vaccine efficacy by lineage. Perhaps most importantly, dynamics in the population structure of M. tuberculosis in response to control measures in high-prevalence areas should be better understood.",NA,NA,genotype;drug resistance;geography;genome;characterization;outbreak;control;transmission,Mycobacterium tuberculosis;Human Immunodeficy Virus,26553974,,

We report here a remarkable case of multiply recurrent tuberculosis in a patient living with HIV. Between 1995 and 2009, a young HIV-infected intravenous drug user, who was reluctant to comply with anti-retroviral treatment, underwent at least five tuberculosis episodes caused by three distinct M. tuberculosis strains sharply differentiated by drug susceptibility profile, genotype and infectious source. Eventually, the patient died during a relapse of tuberculosis due to a notorious multidrug-resistant outbreak-strain, which infected him during a prolonged hospitalization in the epicentre of such outbreak. Whether recurrent tuberculosis is due to a new infection or to reactivation of a previous one is a century-long controversial question. In our patient, both conditions alternated throughout his 15 years of living with HIV.

Despite growing knowledge about the highly diverse population of K. pneumoniae, the evolution and clinical significance of environmental K. pneumoniae, as well as the relationship between clinical and environmental K. pneumoniae, are poorly defined.METHODS: We isolated and sequenced K. pneumoniae from in-patients in a single hospital in Thailand, as well as hospital sewage, and surrounding canals and farms within a 20-km radius.RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of 77â€‰K. pneumoniae (48 clinical and 29 non-clinical isolates) demonstrated that the two groups were intermixed throughout the tree and in some cases resided in the same clade, suggesting recent divergence from a common ancestor. Phylogenetic comparison of the 77 Thai genomes with 286â€‰K. pneumoniae from a global collection showed that Thai isolates were closely related to the clinical sub-population of the global collection, indicating that Thai clinical isolates belonged to globally circulating lineages. Dating of four Thai K. pneumoniae clades indicated that they emerged between 50 and 150Â years ago. Despite their phylogenetic relatedness, virulence factors and Î_-lactamase resistance genes were more numerous in clinical than in environmental isolates. Our results indicate that clinical and environmental K. pneumoniae are closely related, but that hospitals may select for isolates with a more resistant and virulent genotype.CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the clinical relevance of environmental K. pneumoniae isolates.",PMC5264300,10.1186/s13073-017-0397-1,phylogeny;genome;drug resistance,Klebsiella pneumonia,26723873,,

Here we characterised this isolate, six additional K. pneumoniae and one Escherichia coli carrying blaKPC and another K. pneumoniae lacking blaKPC, all isolated in Australia in 2012. Seven K. pneumoniae belonged to clonal complex (CC) 292, associated with blaKPC in several countries. Five with blaKPC-2 plus the isolate lacking a blaKPC gene were sequence type 258 (ST258) and the seventh was the closely related ST512 with blaKPC-3. The eighth K. pneumoniae isolate, novel ST1048, and the E. coli (ST131) also carried blaKPC-2. blaKPC genes were associated with the most common Tn4401a variant, which gives the highest levels of expression, in all isolates. The ST258 isolates appeared to share a similar set of plasmids, with IncFIIK, IncX3 and ColE-type plasmids identified in most isolates. All K. pneumoniae isolates had a characteristic insertion in the ompK35 gene resulting in a frameshift and early termination, but only the ST512 isolate had a GlyAsp insertion in loop 3 of OmpK36 that may contribute to increased resistance. The clinical epidemiology of blaKPC emergence in Australia thus appears to reflect the global dominance of K. pneumoniae CC292 (and perhaps E. coli ST131).

The aadA were the second most abundant cassettes and their prevalence was: - aadA1(25%), aadA2(21%), and aadA5(14%). Other cassettes occurred in lower prevalence of below 5%. Prevalence of Tn21, ISEcp1, ISCR1 and IS26 was 22%, 10%, 15%, and 7% respectively. Majority of Tn21 containing integrons carried a complete set of transposition genes while class 2 integrons were borne on Tn7 transposon. The qnrA genes were detected in 34(3%) isolates while 19(1%) carried qnrB. All qnr genes were in MDR strains carrying integrons containing the ISCR1.

For strains 26695 and J99-R3, 17 and 22 methylated sequence motifs were identified, respectively. For most motifs, almost all sites occurring in the genome were detected as methylated. Twelve novel methylation patterns corresponding to nine recognition sequences were detected (26695, 3; J99-R3, 6). Functional inactivation, correction of frameshifts as well as cloning and expression of candidate methyltransferases (MTases) permitted not only the functional characterization of multiple, yet undescribed, MTases, but also revealed novel features of both Type I and Type II R-M systems, including frameshift-mediated changes of sequence specificity and the interaction of one MTase with two alternative specificity subunits resulting in different methylation patterns. The methylomes of these well-characterized H. pylori strains will provide a valuable resource for future studies investigating the role of H. pylori R-M systems in limiting transformation as well as in gene regulation and host interaction.",PMC3936762,10.1093/nar/gkt1201,clinical;characterization;outbreak,Helicobacter pylori,26814181,,

Recently, several large genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to interferon lambda 3 (IFNÎ»3) that are associated with the spontaneous resolution and successful treatment of HCV infection. These observations are generating intense research activity; the hope is that IFNÎ»3 genetic variants may serve as important predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome and offer new insights into the biological pathways involved in viral control. A pharmacogenomic treatment approach for HCV can now be envisaged, with the incorporation of host genetic variants into a predictive treatment algorithm with other factors. The SNPs associated with the clinical outcome of HCV infection are located some distance from the IFNÎ»3 gene itself, and causal genetic variants have yet to be clearly defined. Locating these causal variants, mapping in detail the IFNÎ»3 signalling pathways and determining the downstream genetic signature so induced will clarify the role of IFNÎ»3 in the pathogenesis of HCV. Clinical studies assessing safety and efficacy in the treatment of HCV with exogenous IFNÎ»3 are currently underway. Early results suggest that IFNÎ»3 treatment inhibits HCV replication and is associated with a limited side effect profile. However, hepatotoxicity in both healthy volunteers and HCV-infected patients has been described. This review discusses the genetic studies that link IFNÎ»3 to both the spontaneous resolution and treatment-induced clearance of HCV and the potential impact of this in clinical practice, the biology of IFNÎ»3 as currently understood and how this may impact on HCV infection, and describes the early studies that assess the role of this cytokine in the treatment of patients with HCV.",PMC3152870,10.1136/gut.2010.222976,clinical;outcome;genome;treatment,Hepatitis C,26973228,,

Intra-host demographic fluctuations that stochastically reduce the effective size of viral populations are a challenge to maintaining genetic diversity during systemic host infection. Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) traverse several anatomical barriers during infection of their arthropod vectors that are believed to impose population bottlenecks. These anatomical barriers have been associated with both maintenance of arboviral genetic diversity and alteration of the variant repertoire. Whether these patterns result from stochastic sampling (genetic drift) rather than natural selection, and/or from the influence of vector genetic heterogeneity has not been elucidated. Here, we used deep sequencing of full-length viral genomes to monitor the intra-host evolution of a wild-type dengue virus isolate during infection of several mosquito genetic backgrounds. We estimated a bottleneck size ranging from 5 to 42 founding viral genomes at initial midgut infection, irrespective of mosquito genotype, resulting in stochastic reshuffling of the variant repertoire. The observed level of genetic diversity increased following initial midgut infection but significantly differed between mosquito genetic backgrounds despite a similar initial bottleneck size. Natural selection was predominantly negative (purifying) during viral population expansion. Taken together, our results indicate that dengue virus intra-host genetic diversity in the mosquito vector is shaped by genetic drift and purifying selection, and point to a novel role for vector genetic factors in the genetic breadth of virus populations during infection. Identifying the evolutionary forces acting on arboviral populations within their arthropod vector provides novel insights into arbovirus evolution.",PMC4909269,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006111,genome;diversity;vector,Dengue virus,27030492,,

Of these cases, only two have involved a history of travel from India, which suggests that they were imported cases. The remaining reported cases include a sporadic case of acute hepatitis E with genotype 4 HEV isolates and identification of the full genome sequence, as well as another case of genotype 4 HEV hepatitis that developed after ingestion of the raw bile juice of a wild bear living on a mountain in southern Korea. Moreover, genotype 3 HEV, which shows close genetic homology with swine HEV in Korea, has been detected in collected human serum samples. Therefore, genotypes 3 and 4 HEV are currently circulating in the Korean community and may be related to zoonotic transmission and food-borne infection. The reported anti-HEV seroprevalence of 17% to 27% in the Korean population suggests that HEV infection has been autochthonously circulating, thereby resulting in subclinical infection in Korea.

Although molecular methods are replacing phage typing the system is still in use and provides a valuable model for study of phage-host interaction. Phage typing depends on the pattern of bacterial resistance or sensitivity to a panel of specific bacteriophages. In the phage typing scheme, S. Typhimurium definitive phage types (DT) 8 and 30 differ greatly in their susceptibility to the 30 typing phages of S. Typhimurium; DT8 is susceptible to 11 phages whereas DT30 is resistant to all typing phages except one phage although both DT8 and DT30 were reported to be associated with a single foodborne salmonellosis outbreak in Ireland between 2009 and 2011. We wished to study the genomic correlates of the DT8 and DT30 difference in phage susceptibility using the whole genome sequence (WGS) of S. Typhimurium DT8 and DT30 representatives.RESULTS: Comparative genome analysis revealed that both S. Typhimurium DT8 and DT30 are lysogenic for three prophages including two S. Typhimurium associated prophages (Gifsy-2 and ST64B) and one S. Enteritidis associated prophage (Enteritidis lysogenic phage S) which has not been detected previously in S. Typhimurium. Furthermore, DT8 and DT30 contain identical clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). Interestingly, S. Typhimurium DT8 harbours an accessory genome represented by a virulence plasmid that is highly related to the pSLT plasmid of S. Typhimurium strain LT2 (phage typed as DT4) and codes a unique methyltransferase (MTase); M.EcoGIX related MTase. This plasmid is not detected in DT30. On the other hand, DT30 carries a unique genomic island similar to the integrative and conjugative element (ICE) of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and encodes type IV secretion pathway system (T4SS) and several hypothetical proteins. This genomic island is not detected in DT8.CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that differences in phage susceptibility between DT8 and DT30 may be related to acquisition of ICE in DT30 and loss of pSLT like plasmid that might be associated with DT30 resistance to almost all phages used in the typing scheme. Additional studies are required to determine the significance of the differences among DT8 and DT30 in relation to the difference in phage susceptibility.

The same outcome was seen when limiting the analysis to a single large cluster of related sequences, indicating that our results are not due to shifts in the molecular epidemiology of the epidemic in Japan. Moreover, the change in RC was independent of genetic distance between patient-derived sequences and wild-type NL4-3, thus ruling out potential temporal bias due to genetic similarity between patient and historic viral backbone sequences. Collectively, these data indicate that Gag-Protease-associated HIV-1 replication capacity has decreased over the epidemic in Japan.

Both whole-genome sequencing analysis (WGS) and epidemiologic investigations were performed to describe the transmission patterns of these Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Results: By WGS analysis, two genomic clusters including 7 and 2 Mycobacterium tuberculosis were noticed, respectively. The cluster of 2 cases possessed more than 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when compared to the cluster of 7 cases and suggesting that the transmission route was independent. The transmission chain based on the SNPs difference showed the process of the propagation direction and the accumulation of drug resistance mutations in each cluster.

We evaluated the performance of a new NGS assay (Hospital Acquired Infection BioDetection System; Pathogenica) during an outbreak of sequence type 131 (ST131) Escherichia coli infections in a nursing home in The Netherlands. The assay was performed on 56 extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli isolates collected during 2 prevalence surveys (March and May 2013). Typing results were compared to those of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), whereby we visually assessed the agreement of the BioDetection phylogenetic tree with clusters defined by AFLP. A microarray was considered the gold standard for detection of resistance genes. AFLP identified a large cluster of 31 indistinguishable isolates on adjacent departments, indicating clonal spread. The BioDetection phylogenetic tree showed that all isolates of this outbreak cluster were strongly related, while the further arrangement of the tree also largely agreed with other clusters defined by AFLP. The BioDetection assay detected ESBL genes in all but 1 isolate (sensitivity, 98%) but was unable to discriminate between ESBL and non-ESBL TEM and SHV beta-lactamases or to specify CTX-M genes by group.

The reported incidence of C. difficile infection has changed dramatically over the last decade and has been related to the emergence of distinct clonal lineages that appear more transmissible and cause more severe infection. These include PCR ribotypes 027, 017 and more recently 078. Population biology studies using multilocus sequence typing and whole-genome comparisons has helped to define the C. difficile species into four clonal complexes that include PCR ribotypes 027, 017, 078 and 023, as well as a general grouping of most other PCR ribotypes. Further analysis of strains from diverse sources and geographical origins reveal significant microdiversity of clonal complexes and confirms that C. difficile is continuing to evolve. The study of C. difficile represents a real-time global evolutionary experiment where the pathogen is responding to a range of selective pressures created by human activity and practices in healthcare settings. The advent of whole-genome sequencing coupled with phylogeny (phylogeography and phylohistory) will provide unprecedented detail on the local and global emergence and disappearance of C. difficile clones, and facilitate more rational approaches to disease control.

Recent completion of several full-length C. difficile genomes provided an excellent opportunity to identify potentially unique genes that characterize hypervirulent strains. Based on sequence comparisons between C. difficile strains we describe two gene insertions into the genome of hypervirulent PCR ribotypes 078 and 027. Analysis of these regions, of 1.7 and 4.2 kb, respectively, revealed that they contain several interesting ORFs. The 078 region is inserted intergenically and introduces an enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of several antibiotics. The 027 insert disrupts the thymidylate synthetase (thyX) gene and replaces it with an equivalent, catalytically more efficient, thyA gene. Both gene insertions were used to develop ribotype-specific PCRs, which were validated by screening a large strain collection consisting of 68 different PCR ribotypes supplemented with diverse 078 and 027 strains derived from different geographical locations and individual outbreaks. The genetic markers were stably present in the hypervirulent PCR ribotypes 078 and 027, but were also found in several other PCR ribotypes. Comparative analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphisms, PCR ribotype banding patterns and toxin profiles showed that all PCR ribotypes sharing the same insert from phylogenetically coherent clusters. The identified loci are unique to these clusters, to which the hypervirulent ribotypes 078 and 027 belong.

We analyzed 506 avian specimens collected from poultry in live bird markets and backyard flocks to identify influenza A viruses. Virus isolation-positive specimens (n = 50) were subtyped and their coding-complete genomes were sequenced. The most frequently identified subtypes among LPAI isolates were H9N2, H11N3, H4N6, and H1N1. Less frequently detected subtypes included H1N3, H2N4, H3N2, H3N6, H3N8, H4N2, H5N2, H6N1, H6N7, and H7N9. Gene sequences were compared to publicly available sequences using phylogenetic inference approaches. Among the 14 subtypes identified, the majority of viral gene segments were most closely related to poultry or wild bird viruses commonly found in Southeast Asia, Europe, and/or northern Africa. LPAI subtypes were distributed over several geographic locations in Bangladesh, and surface and internal protein gene segments clustered phylogenetically with a diverse number of viral subtypes suggesting extensive reassortment among these LPAI viruses. H9N2 subtype viruses differed from other LPAI subtypes because genes from these viruses consistently clustered together, indicating this subtype is enzootic in Bangladesh. The H9N2 strains identified in Bangladesh were phylogenetically and antigenically related to previous human-derived H9N2 viruses detected in Bangladesh representing a potential source for human infection. In contrast, the circulating LPAI H5N2 and H7N9 viruses were both phylogenetically and antigenically unrelated to H5 viruses identified previously in humans in Bangladesh and H7N9 strains isolated from humans in China. In Bangladesh, domestic poultry sold in live bird markets carried a wide range of LPAI virus subtypes and a high diversity of genotypes.

The antigenetic characteristics of these viruses distinguish them from others circulating at a global level in pigs. These viruses have remained endemic in European pig populations but significant differences in the circulation of these strains occur at a regional level across Europe. The dynamic of co-circulation of viruses, impact of prior immunity, husbandry practices and other local factors all contribute to the complex epidemiology. Surveillance programmes in European pigs did not reveal the presence of pandemic H1N1 virus prior to its detection in humans in 2009 but there is evidence that the virus can be maintained in European pigs even when there are relatively good levels of herd immunity to other H1 viruses. Evidence for the pig as a 'mixing vessel' of influenza viruses of non-swine-origin has been demonstrated in Europe on several occasions.

It was a hospital-acquired outbreak linked to milkshakes, made from contaminated ice cream mixes and milkshake maker, served to patients. Here we performed multiple analyses on isolates associated with this outbreak: pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, species-specific core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), lineage-specific cgMLST and whole genome-specific MLST (wgsMLST)/outbreak-specific cgMLST. We also analyzed the prophages and virulence genes.RESULTS: The outbreak isolates belonged to sequence type 1038, clonal complex 101, genetic lineage II. There were no pre-mature stop codons in inlA. Isolates contained Listeria Pathogenicity Island 1 and multiple internalins. PFGE and multiple whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses all clustered together food, environmental and clinical isolates when compared to outgroup from the same clonal complex, which supported the finding that L. monocytogenes likely persisted in the softÂ serve ice cream/milkshake maker from November 2014 to November 2015 and caused 3 illnesses, and that the outbreak strain was transmitted between two ice cream production facilities. The whole genome SNP analysis, one of the two species-specific cgMLST, the lineage II-specific cgMLST and the wgsMLST/outbreak-specific cgMLST showed that L. monocytogenes cells persistent in the milkshake maker for a year formed a unique clade inside the outbreak cluster. This clustering was consistent with the cleaning practice after the outbreak was initially recognized in late 2014 and early 2015. Putative prophages were conserved among prophage-containing isolates. The loss of a putative prophage in two isolates resulted in the loss of the AscI restriction site in the prophage, which contributed to their AscI-PFGE banding pattern differences from other isolates.CONCLUSIONS: The high resolution of WGS analyses allowed the differentiation of epidemiologically unrelated isolates, as well as the elucidation of the microevolution and persistence of isolates within the scope of one outbreak. We applied a wgsMLST scheme which is essentially the outbreak-specific cgMLST. This scheme can be combined with lineage-specific cgMLST and species-specific cgMLST to maximize the resolution of WGS.",NA,NA,outbreak;phylogeny;mBio;genome;drug resistance;characterization;genotype,Listeria monocytogenes,28348549,,

Male circumcision reduces BV-associated bacteria on the penis and decreases BV in female partners, but the link between penile microbiota and female partner BV is not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that having a female partner with BV increases BV-associated bacteria in uncircumcised men. We characterized penile microbiota composition and density (i.e., the quantity of bacteria per swab) by broad-coverage 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 165 uncircumcised men from Rakai, Uganda. Associations between penile community state types (CSTs) and female partner's Nugent score were assessed. We found seven distinct penile CSTs of increasing density (CST1 to 7).

Our data support the exchange of BV-associated bacteria through intercourse, which may explain BV recurrence and persistence.</AbstractText>: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal bacterial imbalance associated with risk for HIV and poor gynecologic and obstetric outcomes. Male circumcision reduces BV-associated bacteria on the penis and decreases BV in female partners, but the link between penile microbiota and female partner BV is not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that having a female partner with BV increases BV-associated bacteria in uncircumcised men. We characterized penile microbiota composition and density (i.e., the quantity of bacteria per swab) by broad-coverage 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 165 uncircumcised men from Rakai, Uganda. Associations between penile community state types (CSTs) and female partner's Nugent score were assessed. We found seven distinct penile CSTs of increasing density (CST1 to 7). CST1 to 3 and CST4 to 7 were the two major CST groups. CST4 to 7 had higher prevalence and abundance of BV-associated bacteria, such as Mobiluncus and Dialister, than CST1 to 3. Men with CST4 to 7 were significantly more likely to have a female partner with a high Nugent score (P = 0.03). Men with two or more extramarital partners were significantly more likely to have CST4 to 7 than men with only marital partners (CST4 to 7 prevalence ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 2.92). Female partner Nugent BV is significantly associated with penile microbiota. Our data support the exchange of BV-associated bacteria through intercourse, which may explain BV recurrence and persistence.IMPORTANCE: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is sexually associated but not considered a sexually transmitted disease. Our findings suggest that the uncircumcised penis is an important niche for BV-associated genital anaerobes. In addition, we found a link between extramarital sexual relationships and BV-associated bacteria in men, which parallels earlier findings of the association between sexual activity and BV in women. This suggests the sexual transmissibility of BV-associated bacteria. Reducing bacterial exchange by barrier methods and managing carriage of BV-associated bacteria in men may decrease BV persistence and recurrence in women.",PMC4471566,10.1128/mBio.00589-15,transmission;genome;diversity,Microbiota,21167876;15505215,,

Here, a prototype reverse transcription-recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed. The assay detected DENV RNA in &lt;20 min without the need for thermocycling amplification. The assay enabled the detection of as few as 10 copies of DENV RNA. The designed RT-RPA primers and exo probe detected the DENV genome of at least 12 genotypes of DENV circulating globally without cross-reacting with other arboviruses. We assessed the diagnostic performance of the RT-RPA assay for the detection of DENV RNA in 203 serum samples of patients with clinically suspected dengue. The sera were simultaneously tested for DENV using a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and IgM- and IgG-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Acute DENV infection was confirmed in 130 samples and 61 of the samples (46.9%) were classified as viremic with qRT-PCR. The RT-RPA assay showed good concordance (Îº of â‰¥0.723) with the RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR assays in detecting the dengue viremic samples. When used in combination with ELISA, both the RT-RPA and RT-LAMP assays increased the detection of acute DENV infection to â‰¥95.7% (â‰¥45/47) in samples obtained within 5 days of illness. The results from the study suggest that the RT-RPA assay is the most rapid molecular diagnostic tool available for the detection of DENV. Hence, it is possible to use the RT-RPA assay in a laboratory to complement routine serology testing for dengue.",PMC4390637,10.1128/JCM.02648-14,mBio;clinical;diagnosis,Dengue virus,22411105;21689012,,

PCR with consensus primers will typically detect HPV in &gt;96% of condylomata. Metagenomic sequencing has found that some &quot;HPV-negative&quot; condylomata do indeed contain HPV. We wished to perform a renewed evaluation of the &quot;HPV-negative&quot; condylomata using deeper metagenomics sequencing. Sequencing of whole genome amplified DNA from 40 apparently &quot;HPV-negative&quot; condylomata detected HPV in 37/40 specimens. We found 75 different HPV types, out of which 43 represented novel putative HPV types. Three types were cloned and established as HPV types 200, 201 and 202. Molluscum contagiosum virus was detected in 24 of the 40 samples. In summary, deep sequencing enables detection of HPV in almost all condylomata. &quot;HPV-negative&quot; condylomata might largely be explained by clinical misdiagnosis or the presence of viral variants, distantly related HPV types and/or low viral loads.",NA,NA,genome;diversity;clinical;diagnosis,Microbiota;Human Papillomavirus,22750803;27559074,,

Standardized procedures for identification of relevant genes and of variation are needed to enable comparison between studies and over time. The core genes--the genes that are conserved in all (or most) members of a genus or species--are potentially good candidates for investigating genomic variation in phylogeny and epidemiology.RESULTS: We identify a set of 2,882 core genes clusters based on 73 publicly available Salmonella enterica genomes and evaluate their value as typing targets, comparing whole genome typing and traditional methods such as 16S and MLST. A consensus tree based on variation of core genes gives much better resolution than 16S and MLST; the pan-genome family tree is similar to the consensus tree, but with higher confidence. The core genes can be divided into two categories: a few highly variable genes and a larger set of conserved core genes, with low variance. For the most variable core genes, the variance in amino acid sequences is higher than for the corresponding nucleotide sequences, suggesting that there is a positive selection towards mutations leading to amino acid changes.CONCLUSIONS: Genomic variation within the core genome is useful for investigating molecular evolution and providing candidate genes for bacterial genome typing. Identification of genes with different degrees of variation is important especially in trend analysis.",PMC3359268,10.1186/1471-2164-13-88,cluster;genome,Salmonella Enterica,26365161;22265849,,

Human migrations, after thousands of years of permanent settlement in those lands, resulted in seven prototypes of genetic populations of H. pylori with distinct geographical distributions. In all continents, present day isolates of H. pylori have molecular markers that reflect population migrations. The colonization of the Americas as well as the slave trade introduced European and African strains to the New World. The relationship between H. pylori genome and gastric cancer rates is linked to the presence of the cagA gene, but the knowledge on this subject is incomplete because other genes may be involved in certain populations. A new situation for Homo sapiens is the absence of H. pylori colonization in certain, mostly affluent, populations, apparently brought about by improved home sanitation and widespread use of antibiotics during the last decades. The disappearance of H. pylori from the human microbiota may be linked to emerging epidemics of esophageal adenocarcinoma, some allergic diseases such as asthma and some autoimmune disorders.",PMC3286735,10.5009/gnl.2012.6.1.21,outbreak;international,Helicobacter pylori,26814181;11985969,,

We explored its probable sources and quantified the transmissibility and pathogenicity of TB. Clinical evaluation, tuberculin skin testing and chest radiography were conducted to identify TB cases. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates underwent genotyping analysis to identify the outbreak source. A chain-binomial transmission model was used to evaluate transmissibility and pathogenicity of TB. A total of 46 active cases were ascertained among 258 students and 15 teachers/staff, an attack rate of 16.8%. Genetic analyses revealed two groups of M. tuberculosis cocirculating during the outbreak and possible importation from local communities. Secondary attack rates among students were 4.1% (2.9%, 5.3%) within grade and 7.9% (4.9%, 11%) within class. An active TB case was estimated to infect 8.4 (7.2, 9.6) susceptible people on average. The smear-positive cases were 28 (8, 101) times as infective as smear-negative cases. Previous BCG vaccination could reduce the probability of developing symptoms after infection by 70% (1.4%, 91%). The integration of clinical evaluation, genetic sequencing, and statistical modeling greatly enhanced our understanding of TB transmission dynamics. Timely diagnosis of smear-positive cases, especially in the early phase of the outbreak, is the key to preventing further spread among close contacts.",PMC4427569,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.03.001,transmission;vaccine;genotype,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,27439708;20852939,,

Among all the microbial agents, viruses are the most important causative agents of food-borne outbreaks. The development and application of a new generation of sequencing techniques to test for viral contaminants in fresh produce is an unexplored field that allows for the study of the viral populations that might be transmitted by the fecal-oral route through the consumption of contaminated food. To advance this promising field, parsley was planted and grown under controlled conditions and irrigated using contaminated river water. Viruses polluting the irrigation water and the parsley leaves were studied by using metagenomics. To address possible contamination due to sample manipulation, library preparation, and other sources, parsley plants irrigated with nutritive solution were used as a negative control. In parallel, viruses present in the river water used for plant irrigation were analyzed using the same methodology. It was possible to assign viral taxons from 2.4 to 74.88% of the total reads sequenced depending on the sample. Most of the viral reads detected in the river water were related to the plant viral families Tymoviridae (66.13%) and Virgaviridae (14.45%) and the phage viral families Myoviridae (5.70%), Siphoviridae (5.06%), and Microviridae (2.89%). Less than 1% of the viral reads were related to viral families that infect humans, including members of the Adenoviridae, Reoviridae, Picornaviridae and Astroviridae families. On the surface of the parsley plants, most of the viral reads that were detected were assigned to the Dicistroviridae family (41.52%). Sequences related to important viral pathogens, such as the hepatitis E virus, several picornaviruses from species A and B as well as human sapoviruses and GIV noroviruses were detected. The high diversity of viral sequences found in the parsley plants suggests that irrigation on fecally-tainted food may have a role in the transmission of a wide diversity of viral families. This finding reinforces the idea that the best way to avoid food-borne viral diseases is to introduce good field irrigation and production practices. New strains have been identified that are related to the Picornaviridae and distantly related to the Hepeviridae family. However, the detection of a viral genome alone does not necessarily indicate there is a risk of infection or disease development. Thus, further investigation is crucial for correlating the detection of viral metagenomes in samples with the risk of infection. There is also an urgent need to develop new methods to improve the sensitivity of current Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques in the food safety area.",NA,NA,genome;vector,Microbiota,27559074;24672981,,
